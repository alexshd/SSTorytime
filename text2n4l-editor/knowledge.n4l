- knowledge, background

 These notes are all about how to use N4L and knowledge graphs in general (associated with) How to?

    " (equals) A key issue is how we use context to activate knowledge from memory

 :: things, topics, issues ::

 sense-making (equals) sense making (=) sensemaking
 mapping
 path solving


 orbits (equals) the collection of >nodes linked to a given node to >radius R

 paths  (equals) a collection of sequences of >nodes satisfying given criteria between start and end nodes

 There are two main types of data for a graph database
      "    (contains)  a relationship >map of explanations between >things and >concepts with examples
      "    (contains)  >regularised >data input about >agents, persons, etc as sensory attributes and documented events
      "    (then) The difference between these is whether the >data are first hand and >regular in >schema or attribute sets and are searchable by random access or whether they are only ad hoc explanatory >stories like metadata without all the raw examples.


  graph data can be used in security to map out processes and networks (e.g.) find hidden pathways through a system

 :: getting started ::

 There are many barriers to knowledge and reasoning (consists of) overcoming the reticence or sense of difficulty

 +:: _sequence_ ::

   getting any notes down on the page, with approximate wordings of relationships (note) finding thematic backbones will give you a clue about how to make your notes tell a particular story whether linear or not
   keep text in order if it belongs in order
   separate distinct issues using contexts like subsections
   try to rewrite the approximate wordings in terms of arrows in N4L
   use annotations to cross reference key words
   use the N4L compiler to debug the notes
   upload the notes to the database and browse them further
   add new notes and edit as you see ways to improve (note) the more you work on notes, the more easily understood they will be
   remember that knowledge is not necessarily about facts, but about knowing something like a friend, i.e. how to react to it and what to do with it, when to avoid it etc

 -:: _sequence_ ::


 :: hints and tips  ::

   if you write in your own words, as you think it, you are more likely to recognise your thoughts later

   >rhyme, >rhythm, and >emotion increase the likelihood of remembering knowledge because you activate more of the major agents involved in cogitation 

   avoid using single words as notes as these may occur with different meanings elsewhere. Always qualify words with some explanation, and then you can use >"special annotations" like "writing >word" to link up to the generic word

   if the same words occur in several different cases, use different phrases to write about them then link both to the common phrase so that common phrase acts like an index term instead of a semantic collision (note) remember that notes are events that you are trying to describe not >"immutable truths"

 a lot of notes are >reminders without much >context. Try to add >context that explains >when and >why you would want to being reminded of something.

  n4l notes (e.g.) about >meetings
  n4l notes (e.g.) about >complaints
  n4l notes (e.g.) what&#39;s on your minds, with >context to be meaningful again in future

  reminders (e.g.) a set of ad hoc observations
      "     (e.g.) an idea or concept you think of ad hoc


  >link >arrow types used in notes (e.g.) >arrow "remember to"
              "                    (e.g.) >arrow "then do next"
              "                    (e.g.) >arrow "then verify"
              "                    (e.g.) >arrow "requires daily/monthly.."
              "                    (e.g.) >arrow "rehearse daily/monthly.."
              "                    (e.g.) >arrow "has emergency procedure"
                                   
 
  the most frequent >events are often the least >important

  the most important >context is often how you were feeling (e.g.) people don&#39;t remember what you say, but how you made them feel

 Semantic spacetime (consists of) >"three kinds of node" and >"four kinds of link"


 three kinds of node (is a part of) quasi ontology for >"Semantic spacetime"

       "             (contains) >nodes that are >"events" (belongs to) processes (e.g.) scene descriptions
       "             (contains) >nodes that are >"concepts" or descriptive >"attributes" (belongs to) virtual space
       "             (contain ) >nodes that are "material agents" (belongs to) physical space
 
  material agents   (e.g.) >people and >things (i.e.) things that manifestly exist, not just >concepts or >ideas

  material agent axiom (equals) there exists a class of >nodes that are >"material nodes" that manifest sources of >"causal change" and there exists a class of >"immaterial nodes" as >concepts that cannot exists without being bound to a material agent.

  four kinds of link (is a part of) quasi ontology for >"semantic spacetime"

        "       (contains) >arrow >class >"leads to"
        "       (contains) >arrow >class >"contains"
        "       (contains) >arrow >class >"expresses attribute" or >property
        "       (contains) >arrow >class >"similar to" or >"near" 


  the >"inverse path tracing problem" (comes from) the >"division by zero" inverse issue (note) if we have an absorbing state that&#39;s N:1 it is not uniquely invertible, but can be defined by algebra

 :: facts , statements ::

 a fact is a trusted statement (remark) a fact may or may not have supporting evidence

 correctness
 right answers
 wrong answers

 :: context , general::

 Context is the description of a scene or circumstances in which facts have relevance.

 Context (has feature) knowledge

 Context makes sense of facts, and tells us when they apply.

 Context (comes from) sensory experience
  "      (comes from) group behaviour

 There are two kinds of context

 context (generalizes) strategic context (=) strategic labelling / tagging
     "   (generalizes) scene description 
     "   (generalizes) problem description
     "   (generalizes) questions we have

 colon bracketing :: ... :: (is a part of) note taking
        "                   (creates) arrow definitions

    "   (NB) colon bracketing in arrows is not currently functional

 colon bracketing :: ... :: (determines)  strategic context 

 #

 :: Question types ::

 What is it about?
 Which kind is it? (=) What kind of?
 What causes? (=) What determines? (=) What generates?
 Why does?
 How to?

 :: context , questions , problem description ::

 How do we use context? (associated with) How to?

 Strategic context (contains) What?

 # 

 ::: Searching, semantic strategies ::

 Look for key words in strategic context tags
 Look for key words in section/chapter name

 Get all causal consequences
 Get all generalizations 
 Get all specializations

 Get all similar  (how) generalize up/CONTAINED BY then come back down/CONTAINS
