# Go Workspace Setup - Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-17  
**Repository**: SSTorytime  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

## What Was Done

### 1. Created `go.work` File

Unified all 7 Go modules into a single workspace:

```go
go 1.23

use (
    .                                          # Root module
    ./editors/tree-sitter-n4l/bindings/go     # Tree-sitter bindings
    ./n4l                                      # N4L module
    ./pkg/SSTorytime                           # Core package
    ./src                                      # Source module
    ./src/mazeexample                          # Maze example
    ./text2n4l-web                             # Web interface
)
```

### 2. Updated `.gitignore`

Added workspace files to prevent accidental commits:

```gitignore
# Go workspace (local development only)
go.work
go.work.sum
```

### 3. Verified Workspace Works

**Before** (needed workaround):

```bash
GOWORK=off go test ./maze  # Had to disable workspace
```

**Now** (seamless):

```bash
go test ./maze             # Just works!
```

### 4. Created Documentation

- `GO_WORKSPACE_README.md` - Complete guide to workspace usage
- Instructions for common tasks
- Troubleshooting tips

## Test Results

‚úÖ Tests run successfully without `GOWORK=off`:

```
cd src/mazeexample
go test ./maze -v           # Works!
go test -bench=. ./maze     # Works!
```

‚úÖ Benchmarks confirmed working:

```
BenchmarkVertex-4      69,337,803    18.08 ns/op    0 B/op    0 allocs/op
BenchmarkVertexUnique-4 20,988,232   53.81 ns/op    4 B/op    1 allocs/op
```

## Benefits Achieved

1. **No more workarounds** - No need for `GOWORK=off` flag
2. **Faster development** - Work across modules seamlessly
3. **Better IDE support** - Improved autocomplete and navigation
4. **Unified testing** - Can test all modules together
5. **Local changes visible** - Edits in one module immediately available to others

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ Created: `/home/alex/SHDProj/SSTorytime/go.work`
- ‚úÖ Created: `/home/alex/SHDProj/SSTorytime/GO_WORKSPACE_README.md`
- ‚úÖ Updated: `/home/alex/SHDProj/SSTorytime/.gitignore`

## Next Steps

The workspace is ready to use! You can now:

- Run tests from any module directory
- Build across modules without special flags
- Make changes that are immediately visible across the codebase
- Enjoy better IDE support for cross-module navigation

## Important

‚ö†Ô∏è The `go.work` file is **gitignored** (not committed)

- It's a local development tool
- Each developer can customize their own workspace
- CI/CD still builds modules independently
