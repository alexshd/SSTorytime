:: brain waves, oscillations ::

alpha waves  (freq) 5-15 Hz
         "    (state) very relaxed, light or passive attention
beta waves  (freq) 12-35 Hz
    "        (state) medium attention,anxiety dominant, active, external attention
gamma waves  (freq) 32-100 Hz
   "         (note) 40 Hz of special interest
   "         (state) concentration
   "  (occurs) premotor cortex
   "  (occurs) parietal cortex
   "  (occurs) temporal cortex
   "  (occurs) frontal cortex

delta waves  (freq) 0.5-4 Hz
   "         (state) sleep
theta waves (freq) 4-8 Hz
    "      (consists of) type 1
    "      (consists of) type 2

:: brain structure , brain parts etc ::

human brain (consists of) forebrain
   "       (consists of)  midbrain
    "      (consists of)  hindbrain

neocortex (hasstruct) modular repeating columns in 6 layers
     "    (role)  accumulating knowledge 
     "    (evolved from)   outgrowth of hypothalamus

hypothalamus (role) key nexus between body and brain , vital decision making circuits
     "     (where) forebrain
     "     (role) monitoring signals in the bloodstream and neural signals
     "     (infl) hormones
     "     (role) regulate bodily functions—blood pressure, heart rate, enzyme levels, digestion, gut peristalsis, sweating, shivering, sleep, arousal
     "     (note) hypothalamus is extensively interconnected with other brain regions that collectively provide signals that motivate different types of behaviors, with varying levels of urgency. The resultant signals of need may be experienced as hunger, thirst, tiredness, cold, pain, fear, and so on; that is, basic emotions.

 "     (infl) urges to eat, drink, sleep, find shelter, avoid whatever is causing pain or fear, or respond with defensive or aggressive behaviours.

 " (evolved from) early telencephalon, meaning the end of the brain
 " (leads to) ultimately expand in mammals to become the neocortex

hormones (infl) autonomic nervous system 

thalamus (where) forebrain

retinal ganglia (where) optic nerve
     "         (signals) tectum, thalamus

columnar organization hypothesis

column (pt-of) neocortex 
column (depends on) tectum, thalamus


// Each column is thus a functional unit designed to take in a variety of inputs, operate on them in some way, communicate with neighbouring column 


basal ganglia (where) below cortex, forebrain
     "         (hasstruct) nested circuit loops
     "         (role) mediates evaluatuon and selection of actions 
     "         (depends on) signal from midbrain about reward/punishment/surprise 
inner chamber

 :: memory, spacetime encoding ::

place cells
grid cells

hippocampus  (role) learning and memory
     "      (role) creates temporary structured episodic record 
     "      (role) structured for causal relationships A causes B

tectum (role) maps incoming sensory stimulus to a menu of actions/instincts
   "   (role) performs various kinds of neural operations, using these integrated maps of different kinds of stimuli to derive an optimal action
   "   (works-by) attractive signals engage a winner-takes-all competition
   "   (note) conditional promises
 
   "    (where) top of midbrain

layer 1 (role) top down modulation
   "    (note) plays a role in intentionality?

layer 2, layer 3 (role) collect sensory information and integrate with neighbouring columns

layer 4 (role) receive inputs from other brain areas

layer 5 (role) take signals from 2,3 and context and redistribute
   "    (signals) tectum, cortex, spine, other hemisphere 

layer 6 (role) feedback mainly to thalamus
   "    (signals) back to thalamus

thalamus (role) conduit/relay station for sensory information
   "     (role) performs significant processing/compression on input

affordances (role) what we can do with a object or service
   "   (note) conditional promises

neurons that fire together wire together

hippocampus (contains) physical structures/neural circuits 


encoding meaning as "things" is efficient conceptualisation, which is a coarse graining of spacetime pattern persistence and recurrence.
