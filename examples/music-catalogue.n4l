  # note categories like pop / rock / classical are useless to a music owner
  # we are never that general. Music is known more intimately

  # There is really no standard for music collections, singles, albums, collections, etc
  # All the details of every track can be different. If tracks has multple parts, like
  # symphonies then they tell stories following on from one another.
