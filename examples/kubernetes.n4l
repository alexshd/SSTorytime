- Kubernetes notes

################

:: core concepts ::

Kubernetes (short for) "K8s"
     "     (represents) a %container %orchestration system
     "     (foundedby) %Google
     "     (maintainedby) %CNCF
     "     (enables) %declarative %automation of containerized workloads

pod (represents) the smallest deployable computing unit in Kubernetes
  "   (named after) "pod of whales" or "pea pod"
  "   (contains) one or more %containers
  "   (runsin) a shared %execution context
  "   (managedby) %controllers

container (managedby) %containerd
kubectl (usefor) interact with %Kubernetes via CLI

operator (implements) a %controller pattern
   "       (manages) complex applications and their components
   "       (uses) %CRDs

:: pods ::

"One-container-per-pod" (ex) usage pattern  // make this an example

A %pod (cancontain) multiple co-located containers that are tightly coupled
This pattern (for) %sidecars, %init containers, and %debugging

A %pod (behaves) persists until deleted
   "   (isnot) a %process
   "   (ex) an %environment for running containers

Restarting a %container (isnot) the same as restarting a %pod

%init containers (runs) during pod startup
        "        (runbefore) main application containers
        "        (usefor) setup tasks like config init or dependency checks

ephemeral containers (usefor) debugging a running pod
         "            (behaves) can be injected into running pods without restarting them
         "            (rule) do not run at pod startup
         "            (excludedfrom) pod restart policy

sidecar container (runswith) main application container
         "         (shares) the %podâ€™s network and storage context
         "         (usefor) %logging, %proxying, %service mesh, and other supportive tasks
         "         (enables) separation of concerns
         "         (termwith) the main container

:: api and extension ::

API server (represents) hub of the cluster API
     "      (https connection with) %nodes
     "      (authby) %"client certs" or %"service account tokens"

'Kubernetes uses a >"hub-and-spoke API pattern". All API usage terminates at the API server.'

service account (injects) %bearer token and %root certificate into pods
kube-proxy (redirects) service IPs to %API server HTTPS endpoints

CRD (short for) Custom Resource Definition
  "   (implements) a way to extend the API
  "   (creates) new RESTful resource paths
  "   (usedby) operator
CRD scope  (how) namespaces
     "     (how) cluster scope

"When you create a new CRD, the Kubernetes API Server creates a new RESTful resource path for each version you specify."

:: control loops and reasoning ::

controller (implements) a %control loop
     "     (behaves) compares %"desired state" and %"actual state"
     "     (implements) reconciliation

reconciliation (means) Observing the %"actual state" and compares to the %"desired state". It infers the steps needed to achieve promised state. (note) This is a kind of %abductive reasoning.

Kubernetes (implements) %autonomous agents making and keeping promises and demonstrates distributed %cooperation without central control

%pod, %PVC, %controller (expr) %promises that define system state

:: storage ::

Persistent Volume (abbrev) %PV
       "           (represents) a piece of storage in the cluster
       "           (provisionedby) an administrator or a %Storage Class
       "           (behaves) managed as a cluster resource
       "           (bindsto) %PVC
       "           (promises) capacity and access modes

Persistent Volume Claim (abbrev) %PVC
        "                (represents) a request for storage by a user
        "                (det) size and access requirements
        "                (bindsto) %PV
        "                (usedby) a %pod to mount storage
        "                (represents) consumer's promise

%Storage Class (det) parameters for dynamic volume provisioning
        "       (usedby) %PVC to request volumes on demand
        "       (represents) abstraction over storage backend e.g. %EBS, %NFS, %CSI

PVC   (enables) storage decoupling from the lifecycle of %pods
  "   (behaves) pods to be rescheduled without data loss

PV (has) a lifecycle independent of individual %pods

"Volumes in Kubernetes can be %ephemeral or %persistent. Ephemeral volumes exist only during the podâ€™s lifetime, while persistent volumes survive pod restarts or rescheduling."

:: system architecture ::

cluster (consists of) %"control plane" and %worker nodes

control plane (includes) %API server, %scheduler, %controller-manager, %etcd

node (runs) %kubelet and %container runtime

kubelet (authenticates) with %"client certificate"
A %"root certificate" should be installed on each %node

kubelet TLS bootstrapping (usefor) automated certificate provisioning

:: networking and security ::

pod (connects to) %API server using injected credentials

kubectl (runs) 'commands like:
  "kubectl get pods -n kube-system"
  "kubectl apply -f https://github.com/app.yml"'

:: resource management ::

Linux control groups (constrain) %resources allocated to processes
  "  (has version) cgroup v1
  "  (has version) v2 (note) this is the new generation

%Kubernetes (uses) cgroups for container resource isolation

:: automation pipelines ::

%CI/CD (short for) Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment
   "   (represents) An approach to %testing, %security scanning, and %deployment

 #
 # Some specific procedures
 #

 :: _sequence_,  pod lifecycle ::

 To create a pod
    A user applies pod.yaml
    The API server stores the pod spec in %etcd
    The scheduler binds the pod to a node
    The kubelet starts containers on the node

 -:: _sequence_ ::

  # next..

 :: _sequence_,  operator upgrade ::

 To do an operator-upgrade

    A CRD defines a new resource version
    The operator observes outdated version
    The operator transforms the resource to new spec
    The system reaches new desired state

 -:: _sequence_ ::

  :: glossary and meta ::
