  :: setup, get started ::

  SSTorytime  (depends on) postgres
       "      (depends on) "postgres_contrib package for unaccent() function"
       "      (depends on) go programming language
       "      (note) made with Linux but doesn't depend on anything specific to Linux
       "      (has feature) supports all human languages in Unicode (note) languages that don't use spaces between words may have some issues


   :: motivation, _sequence_ ::

  The goal is to implement useful search patterns for a graph structure in an efficient way.

  Because database connection is slow, we do as much as possible to reduce that amount of data sent over the wire by performing all processing internally. (note) This has the tradeoff of using a slow script language in the database kernel.

  Loading data into a database, with validation, is slow. Retrieving is much faster.

  A graph is basically a structure with an index at every node. There are two modes of use: random access lookup for starting a search--which SQL is already good at, and exploring, path tracing, following leads from that starting point like hypertext.

  Most graph databases don't give any guidance in modelling or searching. They are based on SQL random access search, but this is not how we need to use graphs. 

  Graphs are for following paths with different meanings - or "semantics".

   :: theory, reasoning, algorithms :: 

  Ranking of n-grams is based on two parts: the %intentionality or amount of %work needed to write them, and the frequency of use

  work (used for) measuring intent

  noise level (def) n-grams that occur less than 

  THEME_LIM  (def) a constant scale approximately the size of a long paragraph set to 100 sentences

  a %paragraph is defined as either a text measure separated by two newlines or if we exceed the the maximum threshold %THEME_LIM

  intent (means) a measure that distinguishes ad hoc or random change from %causal %change
    "    (variant) intentionality
    "    (def)  

  variant (means) a different grammatical form of the same word of phrase
  causal (variant) causality

  %"Short phrases" used once are usually unique names i.e. a %"proper name"

  proper name (means) an ad hoc identifier without descriptive meaning

  %"Longer phrases" used a limited number of times are common concepts (note) %"Longer phrases" are easier to write than short precise phrases, so people need help to break them down and summarize their intent

  The most frequently used n-grams are the least meaningful, used for padding and rhythm

  n-gram (means) fragment of n words as an ordered sequence (note) any sentence can be broken up into n-gram fragments, like a DNA analysis.
     " (variant) n-grams 

  documents can be scanned to identify %context and %factoid parts

  context (means) a collection of signals that identify a scenario, like a scene description language
  factoid (means) a nugget of meaningful information contributing to knowledge

  a text source of document (consists) paragraphs (consists) sentences (consists) punctuated fragments (consists) %n-grams

  punctuated fragments (used for) ranking the %intentionality or importance of text
  sentences   (used for) %factoids and partial %knowledge (ex) factoid

  Knowledge scanned from text is most likely to be in the form of paragraphs and sentences. It needs to be broken down into its constituent parts, like a DNA analysis, to understand its relationship to other notes.

  :: uses, use-cases ::

  Making %notes (note) Notes are more concise than documents, prose, or spoken language. 
        "      (note) Notes are condensed intent without flowery elaboration.
        "      (note) AI and LLMs produce fluid %prose language, which is not in note form.

      "  (might be used for)  Incident reporting with causal commentary
      "  (might be used for)  Risk procedure documentation
      "  (might be used for)  SRE problem diagnosis methods
      "  (might be used for)  HOW-TO sequences and recipes
      "  (might be used for)  Language learning
      "  (might be used for)  Fact based cramming  
      "  (might be used for)  Forensic fact assimilation and reasoning.
      "  (might be used for)  Reasoning with mathematical support (formula) "\( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)"
