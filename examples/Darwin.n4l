@sen5   Beagle, as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen6   These facts, as will be seen in the latter chapters of this volume, seemed to throw some light on the origin of species--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen8   After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up some short notes, these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to me probable, from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object.

@sen10   My work is now, [1859], nearly finished, but as it will take me many more years to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been urged to publish this abstract.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen11   I have more especially been induced to do this, as Mr Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of the Malay Archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of species.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen12   In 1858 he sent me a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it to Sir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published in the third volume of the Journal of that Society.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen14   Lyell and Dr Hooker, who both knew of my work--the latter having read my sketch of 1844--honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with Mr Wallace's excellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.

@sen24   In considering the origin of species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological succession, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created, but had descended, like varieties, from other species.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen25   Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the innumerable species, inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which justly excites our admiration.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen27   In one limited sense, as we shall hereafter see, this may be true, but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions, the structure, for instance, of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak, and tongue, so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen28   In the case of the mistletoe, which draws its nourishment from certain trees, which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite, with its relations to several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external conditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen31   Nor have I been disappointed, in this and in all other perplexing cases I have invariably found that our knowledge, imperfect though it be, of variation under domestication, afforded the best and safest clue.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen33   From these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this abstract to variation under domestication.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen34   We shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible, and, what is equally or more important, we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen35   I will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature, but I shall, unfortunately, be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly, as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen37   In the next chapter the struggle for existence among all organic beings throughout the world, which inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of their increase, will be considered.

@sen38   This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen39   As many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive, and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus be NATURALLY SELECTED.

@sen40   From the strong principle of inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form.

@sen41   This fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter, and we shall then see how natural selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of life, and leads to what I have called divergence of character.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen43   In the five succeeding chapters, the most apparent and gravest difficulties in accepting the theory will be given, namely, first, the difficulties of transitions, or how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or into an elaborately constructed organ, secondly the subject of instinct, or the mental powers of animals, thirdly, hybridism, or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed, and fourthly, the imperfection of the geological record.
              " (quote is found in) part 0 of Darwin.dat

@sen44   In the next chapter I shall consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time, in the twelfth and thirteenth, their geographical distribution throughout space, in the fourteenth, their classification or mutual affinities, both when mature and in an embryonic condition.

@sen47   Who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare?
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen48   Yet these relations are of the highest importance, for they determine the present welfare and, as I believe, the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen50   Although much remains obscure, and will long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which most naturalists until recently entertained, and which I formerly entertained--namely, that each species has been independently created--is erroneous.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen51   I am fully convinced that species are not immutable, but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen52   Furthermore, I am convinced that natural selection has been the most important, but not the exclusive, means of modification.

@sen60   When we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us is, that they generally differ more from each other than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen61   And if we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment, we are driven to conclude that this great variability is due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from, those to which the parent species had been exposed under nature.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen63   It seems clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to new conditions to cause any great amount of variation, and that, when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally continues varying for many generations.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen65   Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still yield new varieties, our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen66   As far as I am able to judge, after long attending to the subject, the conditions of life appear to act in two ways--directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the reproductive system.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen67   With respect to the direct action, we must bear in mind that in every case, as Professor Weismann has lately insisted, and as I have incidently shown in my work on "Variation under Domestication, there are two factors, namely, the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen68   The former seems to be much the more important, for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under, as far as we can judge, dissimilar conditions, and, on the other hand, dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be nearly uniform.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen70   They may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the offspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several generations are modified in the same manner.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen72   There can, however, be little doubt about many slight changes, such as size from the amount of food, colour from the nature of the food, thickness of the skin and hair from climate, etc.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen73   Each of the endless variations which we see in the plumage of our fowls must have had some efficient cause, and if the same cause were to act uniformly during a long series of generations on many individuals, all probably would be modified in the same manner.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen75   In definite variability is a much more common result of changed conditions than definite variability, and has probably played a more important part in the formation of our domestic races.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen76   We see in definite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which distinguish the individuals of the same species, and which cannot be accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen78   At long intervals of time, out of millions of individuals reared in the same country and fed on nearly the same food, deviations of structure so strongly pronounced as to deserve to be called monstrosities arise, but monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct line from slighter variations.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen79   All such changes of structure, whether extremely slight or strongly marked, which appear among many individuals living together, may be considered as the in definite effects of the conditions of life on each individual organism, in nearly the same manner as the chill effects different men in an in definite manner, according to their state of body or constitution, causing coughs or colds, rheumatism, or inflammation of various organs.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen80   With respect to what I have called the in direct action of changed conditions, namely, through the reproductive system of being affected, we may infer that variability is thus induced, partly from the fact of this system being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions, and partly from the similarity, as Kolreuter and others have remarked, between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct species, and that which may be observed with plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen81   Many facts clearly show how eminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes in the surrounding conditions.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen82   Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even when the male and female unite.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen87   I cannot here give the details which I have collected and elsewhere published on this curious subject, but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement, I may mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in this country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family, which seldom produce young, whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest exception, hardly ever lay fertile eggs.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen89   When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants, though often weak and sickly, breeding freely under confinement, and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy, [of which I could give numerous instances], yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail to act, we need not be surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting irregularly, and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents.
              " (quote is found in) part 1 of Darwin.dat

@sen90   I may add that as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions--for instance, rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches--showing that their reproductive organs are not easily affected, so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very slightly--perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen91   Some naturalists have maintained that all variations are connected with the act of sexual reproduction, but this is certainly an error, for I have given in another work a long list of "sporting plants, as they are called by gardeners, that is, of plants which have suddenly produced a single bud with a new and sometimes widely different character from that of the other buds on the same plant.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen93   They occur rarely under nature, but are far from rare under culture.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen94   As a single bud out of many thousands produced year after year on the same tree under uniform conditions, has been known suddenly to assume a new character, and as buds on distinct trees, growing under different conditions, have sometimes yielded nearly the same variety--for instance, buds on peach-trees producing nectarines, and buds on common roses producing moss-roses--we clearly see that the nature of the conditions is of subordinate importance in comparison with the nature of the organism in determining each particular form of variation, perhaps of not more importance than the nature of the spark, by which a mass of combustible matter is ignited, has in determining the nature of the flames.

@sen95   EFFECTS OF HABIT AND OF THE USE OR DISUSE OF PARTS, CORRELATED VARIATION, INHERITANCE.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen97   With animals the increased use or disuse of parts has had a more marked influence, thus I find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild duck, and this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less, and walking more, than its wild parents.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen99   Not one of our domestic animals can be named which has not in some country drooping ears, and the view which has been suggested that the drooping is due to disuse of the muscles of the ear, from the animals being seldom much alarmed, seems probable.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen103   In monstrosities, the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious, and many instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St Hilaire's great work on this subject.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen106   Colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many remarkable cases could be given among animals and plants.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen107   From facts collected by Heusinger, it appears that white sheep and pigs are injured by certain plants, while dark-coloured individuals escape, Professor Wyman has recently communicated to me a good illustration of this fact, on asking some farmers in Virginia how it was that all their pigs were black, they informed him that the pigs ate the paint-root, [Lachnanthes], which coloured their bones pink, and which caused the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off, and one of the "crackers, [i.e.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen108   Virginia squatters], added, "we select the black members of a litter for raising, as they alone have a good chance of living., Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth, long-haired and coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns, pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes, pigeons with short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen109   Hence if man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will almost certainly modify unintentionally other parts of the structure, owing to the mysterious laws of correlation.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen111   It is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises on some of our old cultivated plants, as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, etc., and it is really surprising to note the endless points of structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly from each other.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen114   But the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance, are endless.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen115   Dr Prosper Lucas' treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the best on this subject.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen117   When any deviation of structure often appears, and we see it in the father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both, but when among individuals, apparently exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent--say, once among several million individuals--and it reappears in the child, the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen121   The laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown, no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, or in different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so, why the child often reverts in certain characteristics to its grandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor, why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone, more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen122   It is a fact of some importance to us, that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted, either exclusively or in a much greater degree, to the males alone.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen123   A much more important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that, at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen124   In many cases this could not be otherwise, thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature, peculiarities in the silk-worm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen127   These remarks are of course confined to the first APPEARANCE of the peculiarity, and not to the primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or on the male element, in nearly the same manner as the increased length of the horns in the offspring from a short-horned cow by a long-horned bull, though appearing late in life, is clearly due to the male element.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen128   Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists--namely, that our domestic varieties, when run wild, gradually but invariably revert in character to their aboriginal stocks.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen129   Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen131   There would be great difficulty in proving its truth, we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen134   Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor soil--in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the DEFINITE action of the poor soil--that they would, to a large extent, or even wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of Darwin.dat

@sen135   Whether or not the experiment would succeed is not of great importance for our line of argument, for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen136   If it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion--that is, to lose their acquired characters, while kept under the same conditions and while kept in a considerable body, so that free intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations in their structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen137   But there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view, to assert that we could not breed our cart and race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds, and esculent vegetables, for an unlimited number of generations, would be opposed to all experience.

              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen139   When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants, and compare them with closely allied species, we generally perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of character than in true species.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen140   Domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character, by which I mean, that, although differing from each other and from other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both when compared one with another, and more especially when compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest allied.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen141   With these exceptions, [and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed--a subject hereafter to be discussed], domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as do the closely allied species of the same genus in a state of nature, but the differences in most cases are less in degree.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen142   This must be admitted as true, for the domestic races of many animals and plants have been ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species, and by other competent judges as mere varieties.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen145   It can be shown that this statement is not correct, but naturalists differ much in determining what characters are of generic value, all such valuations being at present empirical.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen146   When it is explained how genera originate under nature, it will be seen that we have no right to expect often to find a generic amount of difference in our domesticated races.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen148   This point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting, for instance, it could be shown that the greyhound, bloodhound, terrier, spaniel and bull-dog, which we all know propagate their kind truly, were the offspring of any single species, then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many closely allied natural species--for instance, of the many foxes--inhabiting the different quarters of the world.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen149   I do not believe, as we shall presently see, that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication, I believe that a small part of the difference is due to their being descended from distinct species.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen151   It has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and likewise to withstand diverse climates.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen152   I do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions, but how could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed an animal, whether it would vary in succeeding generations, and whether it would endure other climates?
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen154   I cannot doubt that if other animals and plants, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries, were taken from a state of nature, and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication, they would on an average vary as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied.
              " (quote is found in) part 3 of Darwin.dat

@sen217   If the several breeds are not varieties, and have not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks, for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number, how, for instance, could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop?

@sen225   Again, all recent experience shows that it is difficult to get wild animals to breed freely under domestication, yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons, it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite prolific under confinement.

@sen226   An argument of great weight, and applicable in several other cases, that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally with the wild rock-pigeon in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts of their structure, yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts, we may look in vain through the whole great family of Columbidae for a beak like that of the English carrier, or that of the short-faced tumbler, or barb, for reversed feathers like those of the Jacobin, for a crop like that of the pouter, for tail-feathers like those of the fantail.

@sen238   To give one instance out of several which I have observed, I crossed some white fantails, which breed very true, with some black barbs--and it so happens that blue varieties of barbs are so rare that I never heard of an instance in England, and the mongrels were black, brown and mottled.

@sen244   secondly, that each breed, even the purest, has within a dozen, or at most within a score, of generations, been crossed by the rock-pigeon, I say within a dozen or twenty generations, for no instance is known of crossed descendants reverting to an ancestor of foreign blood, removed by a greater number of generations.

@sen252   From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having formerly made seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication--these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state, and their not having become anywhere feral--these species presenting certain very abnormal characters, as compared with all other Columbidae, though so like the rock-pigeon in most other respects--the occasional reappearance of the blue colour and various black marks in all the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed--and lastly, the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile--from these several reasons, taken together, we may safely conclude that all our domestic breeds are descended from the rock-pigeon or Columba livia with its geographical sub-species.

@sen255   Secondly, that although an English carrier or a short-faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the rock-pigeon, yet that by comparing the several sub-breeds of these two races, more especially those brought from distant countries, we can make, between them and the rock-pigeon, an almost perfect series, so we can in some other cases, but not with all the breeds.

@sen550   Alphonse de Candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wide ranges generally present varieties, and this might have been expected, as they are exposed to diverse physical conditions, and as they come into competition, [which, as we shall hereafter see, is a far more important circumstance], with different sets of organic beings.

@sen551   But my tables further show that, in any limited country, the species which are the most common, that is abound most in individuals, and the species which are most widely diffused within their own country, [and this is a different consideration from wide range, and to a certain extent from commonness], oftenest give rise to varieties sufficiently well-marked to have been recorded in botanical works.

@sen552   Hence it is the most flourishing, as they may be called, the dominant species--those which range widely, are the most diffused in their own country, and are the most numerous in individuals--which oftenest produce well-marked varieties, as I consider them, incipient species.

@sen553   And this, perhaps, might have been anticipated, for, as varieties, in order to become in any degree permanent, necessarily have to struggle with the other inhabitants of the country, the species which are already dominant will be the most likely to yield offspring, which, though in some slight degree modified, still inherit those advantages that enabled their parents to become dominant over their compatriots.

@sen561   This might have been anticipated, for the mere fact of many species of the same genus inhabiting any country, shows that there is something in the organic or inorganic conditions of that country favourable to the genus, and, consequently, we might have expected to have found in the larger genera, or those including many species, a larger proportional number of dominant species.

@sen567   From looking at species as only strongly marked and well-defined varieties, I was led to anticipate that the species of the larger genera in each country would oftener present varieties, than the species of the smaller genera, for wherever many closely related species, [i.e., species of the same genus], have been formed, many varieties or incipient species ought, as a general rule, to be now forming.

@sen571   To test the truth of this anticipation I have arranged the plants of twelve countries, and the coleopterous insects of two districts, into two nearly equal masses, the species of the larger genera on one side, and those of the smaller genera on the other side, and it has invariably proved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on the side of the larger genera presented varieties, than on the side of the smaller genera.

@sen574   These facts are of plain signification on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties, for wherever many species of the same genus have been formed, or where, if we may use the expression, the manufactory of species has been active, we ought generally to find the manufactory still in action, more especially as we have every reason to believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one.

@sen576   It is not that all large genera are now varying much, and are thus increasing in the number of their species, or that no small genera are now varying and increasing, for if this had been so, it would have been fatal to my theory, inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that small genera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size, and that large genera have often come to their maxima, declined, and disappeared.

@sen618   It has been seen in the last chapter that among organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variability, indeed I am not aware that this has ever been disputed.
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen619   It is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or sub-species or varieties, what rank, for instance, the two or three hundred doubtful forms of British plants are entitled to hold, if the existence of any well-marked varieties be admitted.
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen621   How have all those exquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life and of one organic being to another being, been perfected?
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen622   We see these beautiful co-adaptations most plainly in the woodpecker and the mistletoe, and only a little less plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of a quadruped or feathers of a bird, in the structure of the beetle which dives through the water, in the plumed seed which is wafted by the gentlest breeze, in short, we see beautiful adaptations everywhere and in every part of the organic world.
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen623   Again, it may be asked, how is it that varieties, which I have called incipient species, become ultimately converted into good and distinct species, which in most cases obviously differ from each other far more than do the varieties of the same species?
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen624   How do those groups of species, which constitute what are called distinct genera and which differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus, arise?
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen625   All these results, as we shall more fully see in the next chapter, follow from the struggle for life.
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen626   Owing to this struggle, variations, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if they be in any degree profitable to the individuals of a species, in their infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their physical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation of such individuals, and will generally be inherited by the offspring.
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen627   The offspring, also, will thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive.
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen628   I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection.
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen629   But the expression often used by Mr Herbert Spencer, of the Survival of the Fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.
              " (quote is found in) part 13 of Darwin.dat

@sen630   We have seen that man by selection can certainly produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his own uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him by the hand of Nature.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen631   But Natural Selection, we shall hereafter see, is a power incessantly ready for action, and is as immeasurably superior to man's feeble efforts, as the works of Nature are to those of Art.

@sen641   I should premise that I use this term in a large and metaphorical sense, including dependence of one being on another, and including, [which is more important], not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny.

@sen647   As the mistletoe is disseminated by birds, its existence depends on them, and it may metaphorically be said to struggle with other fruit-bearing plants, in tempting the birds to devour and thus disseminate its seeds.

@sen648   In these several senses, which pass into each other, I use for convenience sake the general term of Struggle for Existence.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen650   A struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at which all organic beings tend to increase.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen651   Every being, which during its natural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds, must suffer destruction during some period of its life, and during some season or occasional year, otherwise, on the principle of geometrical increase, its numbers would quickly become so inordinately great that no country could support the product.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen652   Hence, as more individuals are produced than can possibly survive, there must in every case be a struggle for existence, either one individual with another of the same species, or with the individuals of distinct species, or with the physical conditions of life.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen653   It is the doctrine of Malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms, for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food, and no prudential restraint from marriage.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen654   Although some species may be now increasing, more or less rapidly, in numbers, all cannot do so, for the world would not hold them.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen656   Even slow-breeding man has doubled in twenty-five years, and at this rate, in less than a thousand years, there would literally not be standing room for his progeny.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen658   The elephant is reckoned the slowest breeder of all known animals, and I have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate of natural increase, it will be safest to assume that it begins breeding when thirty years old, and goes on breeding till ninety years old, bringing forth six young in the interval, and surviving till one hundred years old, if this be so, after a period of from 740 to 750 years there would be nearly nineteen million elephants alive descended from the first pair.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen659   But we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoretical calculations, namely, the numerous recorded cases of the astonishingly rapid increase of various animals in a state of nature, when circumstances have been favourable to them during two or three following seasons.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen660   Still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animals of many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world, if the statements of the rate of increase of slow-breeding cattle and horses in South America, and latterly in Australia, had not been well authenticated, they would have been incredible.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen661   So it is with plants, cases could be given of introduced plants which have become common throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen662   Several of the plants, such as the cardoon and a tall thistle, which are now the commonest over the wide plains of La Plata, clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion of every other plant, have been introduced from Europe, and there are plants which now range in India, as I hear from Dr Falconer, from Cape Comorin to the Himalaya, which have been imported from America since its discovery.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen663   In such cases, and endless others could be given, no one supposes that the fertility of the animals or plants has been suddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen664   The obvious explanation is that the conditions of life have been highly favourable, and that there has consequently been less destruction of the old and young and that nearly all the young have been enabled to breed.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen665   Their geometrical ratio of increase, the result of which never fails to be surprising, simply explains their extraordinarily rapid increase and wide diffusion in their new homes.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen666   In a state of nature almost every full-grown plant annually produces seed, and among animals there are very few which do not annually pair.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen667   Hence we may confidently assert that all plants and animals are tending to increase at a geometrical ratio--that all would rapidly stock every station in which they could any how exist, and that this geometrical tendency to increase must be checked by destruction at some period of life.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen668   Our familiarity with the larger domestic animals tends, I think, to mislead us, we see no great destruction falling on them, and we do not keep in mind that thousands are annually slaughtered for food, and that in a state of nature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen669   The only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs or seeds by the thousand, and those which produce extremely few, that the slow breeders would require a few more years to people, under favourable conditions, a whole district, let it be ever so large.
              " (quote is found in) part 14 of Darwin.dat

@sen676   If an animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young, a small number may be produced, and yet the average stock be fully kept up, but if many eggs or young are destroyed, many must be produced or the species will become extinct.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen677   It would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree, which lived on an average for a thousand years, if a single seed were produced once in a thousand years, supposing that this seed were never destroyed and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place, so that, in all cases, the average number of any animal or plant depends only indirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen678   In looking at Nature, it is most necessary to keep the foregoing considerations always in mind--never to forget that every single organic being may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase in numbers, that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life, that heavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old during each generation or at recurrent intervals.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen685   This subject of the checks to increase has been ably treated by several authors, and I hope in a future work to discuss it at considerable length, more especially in regard to the feral animals of South America.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen688   With plants there is a vast destruction of seeds, but from some observations which I have made it appears that the seedlings suffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked with other plants.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen689   Seedlings, also, are destroyed in vast numbers by various enemies, for instance, on a piece of ground three feet long and two wide, dug and cleared, and where there could be no choking from other plants, I marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up, and out of 357 no less than 295 were destroyed, chiefly by slugs and insects.

@sen690   If turf which has long been mown, and the case would be the same with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds, be let to grow, the more vigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous, though fully grown plants, thus out of twenty species grown on a little plot of mown turf, [three feet by four], nine species perished, from the other species being allowed to grow up freely.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen691   The amount of food for each species, of course, gives the extreme limit to which each can increase, but very frequently it is not the obtaining food, but the serving as prey to other animals, which determines the average number of a species.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen693   If not one head of game were shot during the next twenty years in England, and, at the same time, if no vermin were destroyed, there would, in all probability, be less game than at present, although hundreds of thousands of game animals are now annually shot.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen694   On the other hand, in some cases, as with the elephant, none are destroyed by beasts of prey, for even the tiger in India most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam.

@sen696   I estimated, [chiefly from the greatly reduced numbers of nests in the spring], that the winter of 1854-5 destroyed four-fifths of the birds in my own grounds, and this is a tremendous destruction, when we remember that ten per cent.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen698   The action of climate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle for existence, but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food, it brings on the most severe struggle between the individuals, whether of the same or of distinct species, which subsist on the same kind of food.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen699   Even when climate, for instance, extreme cold, acts directly, it will be the least vigorous individuals, or those which have got least food through the advancing winter, which will suffer the most.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen700   When we travel from south to north, or from a damp region to a dry, we invariably see some species gradually getting rarer and rarer, and finally disappearing, and the change of climate being conspicuous, we are tempted to attribute the whole effect to its direct action.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen701   But this is a false view, we forget that each species, even where it most abounds, is constantly suffering enormous destruction at some period of its life, from enemies or from competitors for the same place and food, and if these enemies or competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change of climate, they will increase in numbers, and as each area is already fully stocked with inhabitants, the other species must decrease.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen702   When we travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers, we may feel sure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured, as in this one being hurt.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen703   So it is when we travel northward, but in a somewhat lesser degree, for the number of species of all kinds, and therefore of competitors, decreases northward, hence in going northward, or in ascending a mountain, we far oftener meet with stunted forms, due to the DIRECTLY injurious action of climate, than we do in proceeding southward or in descending a mountain.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen704   When we reach the Arctic regions, or snow-capped summits, or absolute deserts, the struggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen705   That climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species we clearly see in the prodigious number of plants which in our gardens can perfectly well endure our climate, but which never become naturalised, for they cannot compete with our native plants nor resist destruction by our native animals.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen706   When a species, owing to highly favourable circumstances, increases inordinately in numbers in a small tract, epidemics--at least, this seems generally to occur with our game animals--often ensue, and here we have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen707   But even some of these so-called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms, which have from some cause, possibly in part through facility of diffusion among the crowded animals, been disproportionally favoured, and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen708   On the other hand, in many cases, a large stock of individuals of the same species, relatively to the numbers of its enemies, is absolutely necessary for its preservation.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen709   Thus we can easily raise plenty of corn and rape-seed, etc., in our fields, because the seeds are in great excess compared with the number of birds which feed on them, nor can the birds, though having a superabundance of food at this one season, increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed, as their numbers are checked during the winter, but any one who has tried knows how troublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants in a garden, I have in this case lost every single seed.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen710   This view of the necessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation, explains, I believe, some singular facts in nature such as that of very rare plants being sometimes extremely abundant, in the few spots where they do exist, and that of some social plants being social, that is abounding in individuals, even on the extreme verge of their range.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen712   I should add that the good effects of intercrossing, and the ill effects of close interbreeding, no doubt come into play in many of these cases, but I will not here enlarge on this subject.

@sen714   Many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are the checks and relations between organic beings, which have to struggle together in the same country.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen716   In Staffordshire, on the estate of a relation, where I had ample means of investigation, there was a large and extremely barren heath, which had never been touched by the hand of man, but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature had been enclosed twenty-five years previously and planted with Scotch fir.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen717   The change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath was most remarkable, more than is generally seen in passing from one quite different soil to another, not only the proportional numbers of the heath-plants were wholly changed, but twelve species of plants, [not counting grasses and carices], flourished in the plantations, which could not be found on the heath.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen718   The effect on the insects must have been still greater, for six insectivorous birds were very common in the plantations, which were not to be seen on the heath, and the heath was frequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen719   Here we see how potent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree, nothing whatever else having been done, with the exception of the land having been enclosed, so that cattle could not enter.
              " (quote is found in) part 15 of Darwin.dat

@sen721   Here there are extensive heaths, with a few clumps of old Scotch firs on the distant hill-tops, within the last ten years large spaces have been enclosed, and self-sown firs are now springing up in multitudes, so close together that all cannot live.
              " (quote is found in) part 16 of Darwin.dat

@sen722   When I ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted I was so much surprised at their numbers that I went to several points of view, whence I could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosed heath, and literally I could not see a single Scotch fir, except the old planted clumps.
              " (quote is found in) part 16 of Darwin.dat

@sen724   In one square yard, at a point some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps, I counted thirty-two little trees, and one of them, with twenty-six rings of growth, had, during many years tried to raise its head above the stems of the heath, and had failed.
              " (quote is found in) part 16 of Darwin.dat

@sen727   Here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the Scotch fir, but in several parts of the world insects determine the existence of cattle.
              " (quote is found in) part 16 of Darwin.dat

@sen728   Perhaps Paraguay offers the most curious instance of this, for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild, though they swarm southward and northward in a feral state, and Azara and Rengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in Paraguay of a certain fly, which lays its eggs in the navels of these animals when first born.
              " (quote is found in) part 16 of Darwin.dat

@sen730   Hence, if certain insectivorous birds were to decrease in Paraguay, the parasitic insects would probably increase, and this would lessen the number of the navel-frequenting flies--then cattle and horses would become feral, and this would certainly greatly alter, [as indeed I have observed in parts of South America], the vegetation, this again would largely affect the insects, and this, as we have just seen in Staffordshire, the insectivorous birds, and so onwards in ever-increasing circles of complexity.

@sen738   I have also found that the visits of bees are necessary for the fertilisation of some kinds of clover, for instance twenty heads of Dutch clover, [Trifolium repens], yielded 2,290 seeds, but twenty other heads, protected from bees, produced not one.

@sen744   The number of humble-bees in any district depends in a great measure upon the number of field-mice, which destroy their combs and nests, and Colonel Newman, who has long attended to the habits of humble-bees, believes that "more than two-thirds of them are thus destroyed all over England., Now the number of mice is largely dependent, as every one knows, on the number of cats, and Colonel Newman says, "Near villages and small towns I have found the nests of humble-bees more numerous than elsewhere, which I attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice., Hence it is quite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers in a district might determine, through the intervention first of mice and then of bees, the frequency of certain flowers in that district!

@sen897   I cannot here enter on the necessary details, but if man can in a short time give beauty and an elegant carriage to his bantams, according to his standard of beauty, I can see no good reason to doubt that female birds, by selecting, during thousands of generations, the most melodious or beautiful males, according to their standard of beauty, might produce a marked effect.

@sen898   Some well-known laws, with respect to the plumage of male and female birds, in comparison with the plumage of the young, can partly be explained through the action of sexual selection on variations occurring at different ages, and transmitted to the males alone or to both sexes at corresponding ages, but I have not space here to enter on this subject.

@sen899   Thus it is, as I believe, that when the males and females of any animal have the same general habits of life, but differ in structure, colour, or ornament, such differences have been mainly caused by sexual selection, that is, by individual males having had, in successive generations, some slight advantage over other males, in their weapons, means of defence, or charms, which they have transmitted to their male offspring alone.

@sen926   for instance, a bird of some kind could procure its food more easily by having its beak curved, and if one were born with its beak strongly curved, and which consequently flourished, nevertheless there would be a very poor chance of this one individual perpetuating its kind to the exclusion of the common form, but there can hardly be a doubt, judging by what we see taking place under domestication, that this result would follow from the preservation during many generations of a large number of individuals with more or less strongly curved beaks, and from the destruction of a still larger number with the straightest beaks.

@sen927   It should not, however, be overlooked that certain rather strongly marked variations, which no one would rank as mere individual differences, frequently recur owing to a similar organisation being similarly acted on--of which fact numerous instances could be given with our domestic productions.

@sen928   In such cases, if the varying individual did not actually transmit to its offspring its newly-acquired character, it would undoubtedly transmit to them, as long as the existing conditions remained the same, a still stronger tendency to vary in the same manner.

@sen944   We might have taken the case of insects visiting flowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar, and as pollen is formed for the sole purpose of fertilisation, its destruction appears to be a simple loss to the plant, yet if a little pollen were carried, at first occasionally and then habitually, by the pollen-devouring insects from flower to flower, and a cross thus effected, although nine-tenths of the pollen were destroyed it might still be a great gain to the plant to be thus robbed, and the individuals which produced more and more pollen, and had larger anthers, would be selected.

@sen953   In plants under culture and placed under new conditions of life, sometimes the male organs and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent, now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature, then, as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower, and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would be advantageous on the principle of the division of labour, individuals with this tendency more and more increased, would be continually favoured or selected, until at last a complete separation of the sexes might be effected.

@sen957   Bearing such facts in mind, it may be believed that under certain circumstances individual differences in the curvature or length of the proboscis, etc., too slight to be appreciated by us, might profit a bee or other insect, so that certain individuals would be able to obtain their food more quickly than others, and thus the communities to which they belonged would flourish and throw off many swarms inheriting the same peculiarities.

@sen958   The tubes of the corolla of the common red or incarnate clovers, [Trifolium pratense and incarnatum], do not on a hasty glance appear to differ in length, yet the hive-bee can easily suck the nectar out of the incarnate clover, but not out of the common red clover, which is visited by humble-bees alone, so that whole fields of the red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar to the hive-bee.

@sen960   The difference in the length of the corolla in the two kinds of clover, which determines the visits of the hive-bee, must be very trifling, for I have been assured that when red clover has been mown, the flowers of the second crop are somewhat smaller, and that these are visited by many hive-bees.

@sen961   I do not know whether this statement is accurate, nor whether another published statement can be trusted, namely, that the Ligurian bee, which is generally considered a mere variety of the common hive-bee, and which freely crosses with it, is able to reach and suck the nectar of the red clover.
              " (quote is found in) part 21 of Darwin.dat

@sen963   On the other hand, as the fertility of this clover absolutely depends on bees visiting the flowers, if humble-bees were to become rare in any country, it might be a great advantage to the plant to have a shorter or more deeply divided corolla, so that the hive-bees should be enabled to suck its flowers.

@sen964   Thus I can understand how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted to each other in the most perfect manner, by the continued preservation of all the individuals which presented slight deviations of structure mutually favourable to each other.

@sen965   I am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection, exemplified in the above imaginary instances, is open to the same objections which were first urged against Sir Charles Lyell's noble views on "the modern changes of the earth, as illustrative of geology, but we now seldom hear the agencies which we see still at work, spoken of as trifling and insignificant, when used in explaining the excavation of the deepest valleys or the formation of long lines of inland cliffs.

@sen966   Natural selection acts only by the preservation and accumulation of small inherited modifications, each profitable to the preserved being, and as modern geology has almost banished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a single diluvial wave, so will natural selection banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings, or of any great and sudden modification in their structure.

@sen978   In the first place, I have collected so large a body of facts, and made so many experiments, showing, in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders, that with animals and plants a cross between different varieties, or between individuals of the same variety but of another strain, gives vigour and fertility to the offspring, and on the other hand, that CLOSE interbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility, that these facts alone incline me to believe that it is a general law of nature that no organic being fertilises itself for a perpetuity of generations, but that a cross with another individual is occasionally--perhaps at long intervals of time--indispensable.

@sen981   If an occasional cross be indispensable, notwithstanding that the plant's own anthers and pistil stand so near each other as almost to ensure self-fertilisation, the fullest freedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explain the above state of exposure of the organs.

@sen985   Insects act like a camel-hair pencil, and it is sufficient, to ensure fertilisation, just to touch with the same brush the anthers of one flower and then the stigma of another, but it must not be supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids between distinct species, for if a plant's own pollen and that from another species are placed on the same stigma, the former is so prepotent that it invariably and completely destroys, as has been shown by Gartner, the influence of the foreign pollen.

@sen986   When the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil, or slowly move one after the other towards it, the contrivance seems adapted solely to ensure self-fertilisation, and no doubt it is useful for this end, but the agency of insects is often required to cause the stamens to spring forward, as Kolreuter has shown to be the case with the barberry, and in this very genus, which seems to have a special contrivance for self-fertilisation, it is well known that, if closely-allied forms or varieties are planted near each other, it is hardly possible to raise pure seedlings, so largely do they naturally cross.
              " (quote is found in) part 21 of Darwin.dat

@sen987   In numerous other cases, far from self-fertilisation being favoured, there are special contrivances which effectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower, as I could show from the works of Sprengel and others, as well as from my own observations, for instance, in Lobelia fulgens, there is a really beautiful and elaborate contrivance by which all the infinitely numerous pollen-granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower, before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them, and as this flower is never visited, at least in my garden, by insects, it never sets a seed, though by placing pollen from one flower on the stigma of another, I raise plenty of seedlings.

@sen989   In very many other cases, though there is no special mechanical contrivance to prevent the stigma receiving pollen from the same flower, yet, as Sprengel, and more recently Hildebrand and others have shown, and as I can confirm, either the anthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation, or the stigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready, so that these so-named dichogamous plants have in fact separated sexes, and must habitually be crossed.

@sen1150   After the foregoing discussion, which has been much compressed, we may assume that the modified descendants of any one species will succeed so much the better as they become more diversified in structure, and are thus enabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings.

@sen1154   I have said a large genus, because as we saw in the second chapter, on an average more species vary in large genera than in small genera, and the varying species of the large genera present a greater number of varieties.

@sen1158   The variations are supposed to be extremely slight, but of the most diversified nature, they are not supposed all to appear simultaneously, but often after long intervals of time, nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods.

@sen1160   And here the importance of the principle of benefit derived from divergence of character comes in, for this will generally lead to the most different or divergent variations, [represented by the outer dotted lines], being preserved and accumulated by natural selection.

@sen1161   When a dotted line reaches one of the horizontal lines, and is there marked by a small numbered letter, a sufficient amount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to form it into a fairly well-marked variety, such as would be thought worthy of record in a systematic work.

@sen1164   These two varieties will generally still be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable, and the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary, consequently they will likewise tend to vary, and commonly in nearly the same manner as did their parents.

@sen1165   Moreover, these two varieties, being only slightly modified forms, will tend to inherit those advantages which made their parent, [A], more numerous than most of the other inhabitants of the same country, they will also partake of those more general advantages which made the genus to which the parent-species belonged, a large genus in its own country.

@sen1168   And after this interval, variety a1 is supposed in the diagram to have produced variety a2, which will, owing to the principle of divergence, differ more from, [A], than did variety a1.

@sen1170   We may continue the process by similar steps for any length of time, some of the varieties, after each thousand generations, producing only a single variety, but in a more and more modified condition, some producing two or three varieties, and some failing to produce any.

@sen1173   But I must here remark that I do not suppose that the process ever goes on so regularly as is represented in the diagram, though in itself made somewhat irregular, nor that it goes on continuously, it is far more probable that each form remains for long periods unaltered, and then again undergoes modification.

@sen1174   Nor do I suppose that the most divergent varieties are invariably preserved, a medium form may often long endure, and may or may not produce more than one modified descendant, for natural selection will always act according to the nature of the places which are either unoccupied or not perfectly occupied by other beings, and this will depend on infinitely complex relations.

@sen1178   As all the modified descendants from a common and widely-diffused species, belonging to a large genus, will tend to partake of the same advantages which made their parent successful in life, they will generally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character, this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branches proceeding from, [A]

@sen1184   If we suppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagram to be excessively small, these three forms may still be only well-marked varieties, but we have only to suppose the steps in the process of modification to be more numerous or greater in amount, to convert these three forms into doubtful or at least into well-defined species, thus the diagram illustrates the steps by which the small differences distinguishing varieties are increased into the larger differences distinguishing species.

@sen1193   As in each fully stocked country natural selection necessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in the struggle for life over other forms, there will be a constant tendency in the improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminate in each stage of descent their predecessors and their original progenitor.

@sen1249   If we take as the standard of high organisation, the amount of differentiation and specialisation of the several organs in each being when adult, [and this will include the advancement of the brain for intellectual purposes], natural selection clearly leads towards this standard, for all physiologists admit that the specialisation of organs, inasmuch as in this state they perform their functions better, is an advantage to each being, and hence the accumulation of variations tending towards specialisation is within the scope of natural selection.

@sen1395   This is certainly not the case if we look at the two whole faunas, with respect to the insects alone, Schiodte has remarked, "We are accordingly prevented from considering the entire phenomenon in any other light than something purely local, and the similarity which is exhibited in a few forms between the Mammoth Cave, [in Kentucky], and the caves in Carniola, otherwise than as a very plain expression of that analogy which subsists generally between the fauna of Europe and of North America., On my view we must suppose that American animals, having in most cases ordinary powers of vision, slowly migrated by successive generations from the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the Kentucky caves, as did European animals into the caves of Europe.

@sen1396   We have some evidence of this gradation of habit, for, as Schiodte remarks, "We accordingly look upon the subterranean faunas as small ramifications which have penetrated into the earth from the geographically limited faunas of the adjacent tracts, and which, as they extended themselves into darkness, have been accommodated to surrounding circumstances.

@sen1399   By the time that an animal had reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have effected other changes, such as an increase in the length of the antennae or palpi, as a compensation for blindness.

@sen1405   Another blind genus, [Anophthalmus], offers this remarkable peculiarity, that the species, as Mr Murray observes, have not as yet been found anywhere except in caves, yet those which inhabit the several caves of Europe and America are distinct, but it is possible that the progenitors of these several species, while they were furnished with eyes, may formerly have ranged over both continents, and then have become extinct, excepting in their present secluded abodes.

@sen1406   Far from feeling surprise that some of the cave-animals should be very anomalous, as Agassiz has remarked in regard to the blind fish, the Amblyopsis, and as is the case with the blind Proteus, with reference to the reptiles of Europe, I am only surprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved, owing to the less severe competition to which the scanty inhabitants of these dark abodes will have been exposed.

@sen1408   Habit is hereditary with plants, as in the period of flowering, in the time of sleep, in the amount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate, etc., and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation.

@sen1409   As it is extremely common for distinct species belonging to the same genus to inhabit hot and cold countries, if it be true that all the species of the same genus are descended from a single parent-form, acclimatisation must be readily effected during a long course of descent.

@sen1415   But whether or not this adaptation is in most cases very close, we have evidence with some few plants, of their becoming, to a certain extent, naturally habituated to different temperatures, that is, they become acclimatised, thus the pines and rhododendrons, raised from seed collected by Dr Hooker from the same species growing at different heights on the Himalayas, were found to possess in this country different constitutional powers of resisting cold.

@sen1418   In regard to animals, several authentic instances could be adduced of species having largely extended, within historical times, their range from warmer to colder latitudes, and conversely, but we do not positively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their native climate, though in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case, nor do we know that they have subsequently become specially acclimatised to their new homes, so as to be better fitted for them than they were at first.

@sen1419   As we may infer that our domestic animals were originally chosen by uncivilised man because they were useful, and because they bred readily under confinement, and not because they were subsequently found capable of far-extended transportation, the common and extraordinary capacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the most different climates, but of being perfectly fertile, [a far severer test], under them, may be used as an argument that a large proportion of other animals now in a state of nature could easily be brought to bear widely different climates.

@sen1423   On this view, the capacity of enduring the most different climates by man himself and by his domestic animals, and the fact of the extinct elephant and rhinoceros having formerly endured a glacial climate, whereas the living species are now all tropical or sub-tropical in their habits, ought not to be looked at as anomalies, but as examples of a very common flexibility of constitution, brought, under peculiar circumstances, into action.

@sen1428   In treatises on many kinds of cultivated plants, certain varieties are said to withstand certain climates better than others, this is strikingly shown in works on fruit-trees published in the United States, in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the northern and others for the southern states, and as most of these varieties are of recent origin, they cannot owe their constitutional differences to habit.

@sen1432   On the whole, we may conclude that habit, or use and disuse, have, in some cases, played a considerable part in the modification of the constitution and structure, but that the effects have often been largely combined with, and sometimes overmastered by, the natural selection of innate variations.

@sen1438   The several parts which are homologous, and which, at an early embryonic period, are identical in structure, and which are necessarily exposed to similar conditions, seem eminently liable to vary in a like manner, we see this in the right and left sides of the body varying in the same manner, in the front and hind legs, and even in the jaws and limbs, varying together, for the lower jaw is believed by some anatomists to be homologous with the limbs.

@sen1439   These tendencies, I do not doubt, may be mastered more or less completely by natural selection, thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only on one side, and if this had been of any great use to the breed, it might probably have been rendered permanent by natural selection.

@sen1450   I know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws of correlation and variation, independently of utility, and therefore of natural selection, than that of the difference between the outer and inner flowers in some Compositous and Umbelliferous plants.

@sen1451   Everyone is familiar with the difference between the ray and central florets of, for instance, the daisy, and this difference is often accompanied with the partial or complete abortion of the reproductive organs.

@sen1453   These differences have sometimes been attributed to the pressure of the involucra on the florets, or to their mutual pressure, and the shape of the seeds in the ray-florets of some Compositae countenances this idea, but with the Umbelliferae it is by no means, as Dr Hooker informs me, the species with the densest heads which most frequently differ in their inner and outer flowers.

@sen1454   It might have been thought that the development of the ray-petals, by drawing nourishment from the reproductive organs causes their abortion, but this can hardly be the sole case, for in some Compositae the seeds of the outer and inner florets differ, without any difference in the corolla.
              " (quote is found in) part 32 of Darwin.dat

@sen1457   I may add, as an instance of this fact, and as a striking case of correlation, that in many pelargoniums the two upper petals in the central flower of the truss often lose their patches of darker colour, and when this occurs, the adherent nectary is quite aborted, the central flower thus becoming peloric or regular.

@sen1459   With respect to the development of the corolla, Sprengel's idea that the ray-florets serve to attract insects, whose agency is highly advantageous, or necessary for the fertilisation of these plants, is highly probable, and if so, natural selection may have come into play.
              " (quote is found in) part 32 of Darwin.dat

@sen1460   But with respect to the seeds, it seems impossible that their differences in shape, which are not always correlated with any difference in the corolla, can be in any way beneficial, yet in the Umbelliferae these differences are of such apparent importance--the seeds being sometimes orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the central flowers--that the elder De Candolle founded his main divisions in the order on such characters.

@sen1462   We may often falsely attribute to correlated variation structures which are common to whole groups of species, and which in truth are simply due to inheritance, for an ancient progenitor may have acquired through natural selection some one modification in structure, and, after thousands of generations, some other and independent modification, and these two modifications, having been transmitted to a whole group of descendants with diverse habits, would naturally be thought to be in some necessary manner correlated.

@sen1465   De Candolle has remarked that winged seeds are never found in fruits which do not open, I should explain this rule by the impossibility of seeds gradually becoming winged through natural selection, unless the capsules were open, for in this case alone could the seeds, which were a little better adapted to be wafted by the wind, gain an advantage over others less well fitted for wide dispersal.

@sen1467   The elder Geoffroy and Goethe propounded, at about the same time, their law of compensation or balancement of growth, as Goethe expressed it, "in order to spend on one side, nature is forced to economise on the other side., I think this holds true to a certain extent with our domestic productions, if nourishment flows to one part or organ in excess, it rarely flows, at least in excess, to another part, thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fatten readily.

@sen1472   I will not, however, here give any instances, for I see hardly any way of distinguishing between the effects, on the one hand, of a part being largely developed through natural selection and another and adjoining part being reduced by the same process or by disuse, and, on the other hand, the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to the excess of growth in another and adjoining part.

@sen1474   If under changed conditions of life a structure, before useful, becomes less useful, its diminution will be favoured, for it will profit the individual not to have its nutriment wasted in building up a useless structure.

@sen1475   I can thus only understand a fact with which I was much struck when examining cirripedes, and of which many other instances could be given, namely, that when a cirripede is parasitic within another cirripede and is thus protected, it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace.
              " (quote is found in) part 32 of Darwin.dat

@sen1476   This is the case with the male Ibla, and in a truly extraordinary manner with the Proteolepas, for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists of the three highly important anterior segments of the head enormously developed, and furnished with great nerves and muscles, but in the parasitic and protected Proteolepas, the whole anterior part of the head is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of the prehensile antennae.

@sen1477   Now the saving of a large and complex structure, when rendered superfluous, would be a decided advantage to each successive individual of the species, for in the struggle for life to which every animal is exposed, each would have a better chance of supporting itself, by less nutriment being wasted.

@sen1534   To explain by a simple example what is meant, if in a large genus of plants some species had blue flowers and some had red, the colour would be only a specific character, and no one would be surprised at one of the blue species varying into red, or conversely, but if all the species had blue flowers, the colour would become a generic character, and its variation would be a more unusual circumstance.

@sen1537   It would be almost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the statement, that ordinary specific characters are more variable than generic, but with respect to important characters, I have repeatedly noticed in works on natural history, that when an author remarks with surprise that some important organ or part, which is generally very constant throughout a large group of species, DIFFERS considerably in closely-allied species, it is often VARIABLE in the individuals of the same species.

@sen1544   Or to state the case in another manner, the points in which all the species of a genus resemble each other, and in which they differ from allied genera, are called generic characters, and these characters may be attributed to inheritance from a common progenitor, for it can rarely have happened that natural selection will have modified several distinct species, fitted to more or less widely different habits, in exactly the same manner, and as these so-called generic characters have been inherited from before the period when the several species first branched off from their common progenitor, and subsequently have not varied or come to differ in any degree, or only in a slight degree, it is not probable that they should vary at the present day.

@sen1545   On the other hand, the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus are called specific characters, and as these specific characters have varied and come to differ since the period when the species branched off from a common progenitor, it is probable that they should still often be in some degree variable--at least more variable than those parts of the organisation which have for a very long period remained constant.

@sen1549   The cause of the original variability of these characters is not manifest, but we can see why they should not have been rendered as constant and uniform as others, for they are accumulated by sexual selection, which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection, as it does not entail death, but only gives fewer offspring to the less favoured males.

@sen1572   We may, I think, confidently come to this conclusion, because, as we have seen, these coloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspring of two distinct and differently coloured breeds, and in this case there is nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearance of the slaty-blue, with the several marks, beyond the influence of the mere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance.

@sen1581   As all the species of the same genus are supposed to be descended from a common progenitor, it might be expected that they would occasionally vary in an analogous manner, so that the varieties of two or more species would resemble each other, or that a variety of one species would resemble in certain characters another and distinct species, this other species being, according to our view, only a well-marked and permanent variety.

@sen1671   These difficulties and objections may be classed under the following heads, First, why, if species have descended from other species by fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms?

@sen1673   Secondly, is it possible that an animal having, for instance, the structure and habits of a bat, could have been formed by the modification of some other animal with widely different habits and structure?

@sen1674   Can we believe that natural selection could produce, on the one hand, an organ of trifling importance, such as the tail of a giraffe, which serves as a fly-flapper, and, on the other hand, an organ so wonderful as the eye?

@sen1675   Thirdly, can instincts be acquired and modified through natural selection?

              " (quote is found in) part 37 of Darwin.dat

@sen1680   As natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitable modifications, each new form will tend in a fully-stocked country to take the place of, and finally to exterminate, its own less improved parent-form and other less-favoured forms with which it comes into competition.

@sen1682   Hence, if we look at each species as descended from some unknown form, both the parent and all the transitional varieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process of the formation and perfection of the new form.

@sen1684   It will be more convenient to discuss this question in the chapter on the imperfection of the geological record, and I will here only state that I believe the answer mainly lies in the record being incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed.

@sen1687   Let us take a simple case, in travelling from north to south over a continent, we generally meet at successive intervals with closely allied or representative species, evidently filling nearly the same place in the natural economy of the land.

@sen1690   By my theory these allied species are descended from a common parent, and during the process of modification, each has become adapted to the conditions of life of its own region, and has supplanted and exterminated its original parent-form and all the transitional varieties between its past and present states.

@sen1696   Geology would lead us to believe that most continents have been broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods, and in such islands distinct species might have been separately formed without the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in the intermediate zones.

@sen1698   But I will pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty, for I believe that many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictly continuous areas, though I do not doubt that the formerly broken condition of areas now continuous, has played an important part in the formation of new species, more especially with freely-crossing and wandering animals.

@sen1699   In looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area, we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory, then becoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines, and finally disappearing.

@sen1705   To those who look at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all-important elements of distribution, these facts ought to cause surprise, as climate and height or depth graduate away insensibly.
              " (quote is found in) part 37 of Darwin.dat

@sen1706   But when we bear in mind that almost every species, even in its metropolis, would increase immensely in numbers, were it not for other competing species, that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others, in short, that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related in the most important manner to other organic beings--we see that the range of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively depends on insensibly changing physical conditions, but in large part on the presence of other species, on which it lives, or by which it is destroyed, or with which it comes into competition, and as these species are already defined objects, not blending one into another by insensible gradations, the range of any one species, depending as it does on the range of others, will tend to be sharply defined.
              " (quote is found in) part 37 of Darwin.dat

@sen1707   Moreover, each species on the confines of its range, where it exists in lessened numbers, will, during fluctuations in the number of its enemies or of its prey, or in the nature of the seasons, be extremely liable to utter extermination, and thus its geographical range will come to be still more sharply defined.
              " (quote is found in) part 37 of Darwin.dat

@sen1708   As allied or representative species, when inhabiting a continuous area, are generally distributed in such a manner that each has a wide range, with a comparatively narrow neutral territory between them, in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer, then, as varieties do not essentially differ from species, the same rule will probably apply to both, and if we take a varying species inhabiting a very large area, we shall have to adapt two varieties to two large areas, and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone.
              " (quote is found in) part 37 of Darwin.dat

@sen1709   The intermediate variety, consequently, will exist in lesser numbers from inhabiting a narrow and lesser area, and practically, as far as I can make out, this rule holds good with varieties in a state of nature.
              " (quote is found in) part 37 of Darwin.dat

@sen1710   I have met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varieties intermediate between well-marked varieties in the genus Balanus.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1711   And it would appear from information given me by Mr Watson, Dr Asa Gray, and Mr Wollaston, that generally, when varieties intermediate between two other forms occur, they are much rarer numerically than the forms which they connect.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1712   Now, if we may trust these facts and inferences, and conclude that varieties linking two other varieties together generally have existed in lesser numbers than the forms which they connect, then we can understand why intermediate varieties should not endure for very long periods, why, as a general rule, they should be exterminated and disappear, sooner than the forms which they originally linked together.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1713   For any form existing in lesser numbers would, as already remarked, run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in large numbers, and in this particular case the intermediate form would be eminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on both sides of it.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1714   But it is a far more important consideration, that during the process of further modification, by which two varieties are supposed to be converted and perfected into two distinct species, the two which exist in larger numbers, from inhabiting larger areas, will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety, which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1715   For forms existing in larger numbers will have a better chance, within any given period, of presenting further favourable variations for natural selection to seize on, than will the rarer forms which exist in lesser numbers.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1716   Hence, the more common forms, in the race for life, will tend to beat and supplant the less common forms, for these will be more slowly modified and improved.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1717   It is the same principle which, as I believe, accounts for the common species in each country, as shown in the second chapter, presenting on an average a greater number of well-marked varieties than do the rarer species.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1718   I may illustrate what I mean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept, one adapted to an extensive mountainous region, a second to a comparatively narrow, hilly tract, and a third to the wide plains at the base, and that the inhabitants are all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocks by selection, the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of the great holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breeds more quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow, hilly tract, and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soon take the place of the less improved hill breed, and thus the two breeds, which originally existed in greater numbers, will come into close contact with each other, without the interposition of the supplanted, intermediate hill variety.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1719   To sum up, I believe that species come to be tolerably well-defined objects, and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos of varying and intermediate links, first, because new varieties are very slowly formed, for variation is a slow process, and natural selection can do nothing until favourable individual differences or variations occur, and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be better filled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1720   And such new places will depend on slow changes of climate, or on the occasional immigration of new inhabitants, and, probably, in a still more important degree, on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowly modified, with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting and reacting on each other.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1721   So that, in any one region and at any one time, we ought to see only a few species presenting slight modifications of structure in some degree permanent, and this assuredly we do see.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1722   Secondly, areas now continuous must often have existed within the recent period as isolated portions, in which many forms, more especially among the classes which unite for each birth and wander much, may have separately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representative species.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1723   In this case, intermediate varieties between the several representative species and their common parent, must formerly have existed within each isolated portion of the land, but these links during the process of natural selection will have been supplanted and exterminated, so that they will no longer be found in a living state.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1724   Thirdly, when two or more varieties have been formed in different portions of a strictly continuous area, intermediate varieties will, it is probable, at first have been formed in the intermediate zones, but they will generally have had a short duration.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1725   For these intermediate varieties will, from reasons already assigned, [namely from what we know of the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species, and likewise of acknowledged varieties], exist in the intermediate zones in lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1726   From this cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidental extermination, and during the process of further modification through natural selection, they will almost certainly be beaten and supplanted by the forms which they connect, for these, from existing in greater numbers will, in the aggregate, present more varieties, and thus be further improved through natural selection and gain further advantages.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1727   Lastly, looking not to any one time, but at all time, if my theory be true, numberless intermediate varieties, linking closely together all the species of the same group, must assuredly have existed, but the very process of natural selection constantly tends, as has been so often remarked, to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links.

@sen1731   It would be easy to show that there now exist carnivorous animals presenting close intermediate grades from strictly terrestrial to aquatic habits, and as each exists by a struggle for life, it is clear that each must be well adapted to its place in nature.

@sen1732   Look at the Mustela vison of North America, which has webbed feet, and which resembles an otter in its fur, short legs, and form of tail, during summer this animal dives for and preys on fish, but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters, and preys, like other polecats on mice and land animals.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1735   Here, as on other occasions, I lie under a heavy disadvantage, for, out of the many striking cases which I have collected, I can give only one or two instances of transitional habits and structures in allied species, and of diversified habits, either constant or occasional, in the same species.

@sen1738   Richardson has remarked, with the posterior part of their bodies rather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full, to the so-called flying squirrels, and flying squirrels have their limbs and even the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin, which serves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air to an astonishing distance from tree to tree.

@sen1739   We cannot doubt that each structure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country, by enabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey, or to collect food more quickly, as there is reason to believe, to lessen the danger from occasional falls.

@sen1741   Let the climate and vegetation change, let other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate, or old ones become modified, and all analogy would lead us to believe that some, at least, of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated, unless they also become modified and improved in structure in a corresponding manner.

@sen1742   Therefore, I can see no difficulty, more especially under changing conditions of life, in the continued preservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank-membranes, each modification being useful, each being propagated, until, by the accumulated effects of this process of natural selection, a perfect so-called flying squirrel was produced.

@sen1746   Although no graduated links of structure, fitted for gliding through the air, now connect the Galeopithecus with the other Insectivora, yet there is no difficulty in supposing that such links formerly existed, and that each was developed in the same manner as with the less perfectly gliding squirrels, each grade of structure having been useful to its possessor.

@sen1749   If about a dozen genera of birds were to become extinct, who would have ventured to surmise that birds might have existed which used their wings solely as flappers, like the logger headed duck, [Micropterus of Eyton], as fins in the water and as front legs on the land, like the penguin, as sails, like the ostrich, and functionally for no purpose, like the apteryx?

@sen1751   It must not be inferred from these remarks that any of the grades of wing-structure here alluded to, which perhaps may all be the result of disuse, indicate the steps by which birds actually acquired their perfect power of flight, but they serve to show what diversified means of transition are at least possible.

@sen1752   Seeing that a few members of such water-breathing classes as the Crustacea and Mollusca are adapted to live on the land, and seeing that we have flying birds and mammals, flying insects of the most diversified types, and formerly had flying reptiles, it is conceivable that flying-fish, which now glide far through the air, slightly rising and turning by the aid of their fluttering fins, might have been modified into perfectly winged animals.

@sen1753   If this had been effected, who would have ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had been inhabitants of the open ocean, and had used their incipient organs of flight exclusively, so far as we know, to escape being devoured by other fish?
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1754   When we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit, as the wings of a bird for flight, we should bear in mind that animals displaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldom have survived to the present day, for they will have been supplanted by their successors, which were gradually rendered more perfect through natural selection.
              " (quote is found in) part 38 of Darwin.dat

@sen1755   Furthermore, we may conclude that transitional states between structures fitted for very different habits of life will rarely have been developed at an early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms.

@sen1756   Thus, to return to our imaginary illustration of the flying-fish, it does not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would have been developed under many subordinate forms, for taking prey of many kinds in many ways, on the land and in the water, until their organs of flight had come to a high stage of perfection, so as to have given them a decided advantage over other animals in the battle for life.

@sen1794   How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light, hardly concerns us more than how life itself originated, but I may remark that, as some of the lowest organisms in which nerves cannot be detected, are capable of perceiving light, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their sarcode should become aggregated and developed into nerves, endowed with this special sensibility.

@sen1837   The illustration of the swim-bladder in fishes is a good one, because it shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originally constructed for one purpose, namely flotation, may be converted into one for a widely different purpose, namely respiration.

@sen1916   With several kinds this is effected by the pollen-grains, which are light and incoherent, being blown by the wind through mere chance on to the stigma, and this is the simplest plan which can well be conceived.

@sen1921   This orchid has part of its labellum or lower lip hollowed out into a great bucket, into which drops of almost pure water continually fall from two secreting horns which stand above it, and when the bucket is half-full, the water overflows by a spout on one side.

@sen1924   But Dr Cruger saw crowds of large humble-bees visiting the gigantic flowers of this orchid, not in order to suck nectar, but to gnaw off the ridges within the chamber above the bucket, in doing this they frequently pushed each other into the bucket, and their wings being thus wetted they could not fly away, but were compelled to crawl out through the passage formed by the spout or overflow.

@sen1926   The passage is narrow, and is roofed over by the column, so that a bee, in forcing its way out, first rubs its back against the viscid stigma and then against the viscid glands of the pollen-masses.

@sen1929   When the bee, thus provided, flies to another flower, or to the same flower a second time, and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket and then crawls out by the passage, the pollen-mass necessarily comes first into contact with the viscid stigma, and adheres to it, and the flower is fertilised.

@sen1930   Now at last we see the full use of every part of the flower, of the water-secreting horns of the bucket half-full of water, which prevents the bees from flying away, and forces them to crawl out through the spout, and rub against the properly placed viscid pollen-masses and the viscid stigma.

@sen1933   This antenna, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration to a certain membrane which is instantly ruptured, this sets free a spring by which the pollen-mass is shot forth, like an arrow, in the right direction, and adheres by its viscid extremity to the back of the bee.

@sen1934   The pollen-mass of the male plant, [for the sexes are separate in this orchid], is thus carried to the flower of the female plant, where it is brought into contact with the stigma, which is viscid enough to break certain elastic threads, and retain the pollen, thus effecting fertilisation.

@sen1936   The answer no doubt is, as already remarked, that when two forms vary, which already differ from each other in some slight degree, the variability will not be of the same exact nature, and consequently the results obtained through natural selection for the same general purpose will not be the same.

@sen1939   Finally, then, although in many cases it is most difficult even to conjecture by what transitions organs could have arrived at their present state, yet, considering how small the proportion of living and known forms is to the extinct and unknown, I have been astonished how rarely an organ can be named, towards which no transitional grade is known to lead.

@sen1945   As natural selection acts by life and death, by the survival of the fittest, and by the destruction of the less well-fitted individuals, I have sometimes felt great difficulty in understanding the origin or formation of parts of little importance, almost as great, though of a very different kind, as in the case of the most perfect and complex organs.

@sen1948   The tail of the giraffe looks like an artificially constructed fly-flapper, and it seems at first incredible that this could have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slight modifications, each better and better fitted, for so trifling an object as to drive away flies, yet we should pause before being too positive even in this case, for we know that the distribution and existence of cattle and other animals in South America absolutely depend on their power of resisting the attacks of insects, so that individuals which could by any means defend themselves from these small enemies, would be able to range into new pastures and thus gain a great advantage.

@sen1949   It is not that the larger quadrupeds are actually destroyed, [except in some rare cases], by flies, but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced, so that they are more subject to disease, or not so well enabled in a coming dearth to search for food, or to escape from beasts of prey.

@sen1972   They believe that many structures have been created for the sake of beauty, to delight man or the Creator, [but this latter point is beyond the scope of scientific discussion], or for the sake of mere variety, a view already discussed.

@sen1976   But a still more important consideration is that the chief part of the organisation of every living creature is due to inheritance, and consequently, though each being assuredly is well fitted for its place in nature, many structures have now no very close and direct relation to present habits of life.

@sen1982   With respect to the belief that organic beings have been created beautiful for the delight of man--a belief which it has been pronounced is subversive of my whole theory--I may first remark that the sense of beauty obviously depends on the nature of the mind, irrespective of any real quality in the admired object, and that the idea of what is beautiful, is not innate or unalterable.

@sen2066   Thus a distinguished German naturalist has asserted that the weakest part of my theory is, that I consider all organic beings as imperfect, what I have really said is, that all are not as perfect as they might have been in relation to their conditions, and this is shown to be the case by so many native forms in many quarters of the world having yielded their places to intruding foreigners.

@sen2071   Ray Lankester has recently discussed this subject, and he concludes, as far as its extreme complexity allows him to form a judgment, that longevity is generally related to the standard of each species in the scale of organisation, as well as to the amount of expenditure in reproduction and in general activity.

@sen2073   It has been argued that, as none of the animals and plants of Egypt, of which we know anything, have changed during the last three or four thousand years, so probably have none in any part of the world.

@sen2075   Lewes has remarked, this line of argument proves too much, for the ancient domestic races figured on the Egyptian monuments, or embalmed, are closely similar or even identical with those now living, yet all naturalists admit that such races have been produced through the modification of their original types.

@sen2076   The many animals which have remained unchanged since the commencement of the glacial period, would have been an incomparably stronger case, for these have been exposed to great changes of climate and have migrated over great distances, whereas, in Egypt, during the last several thousand years, the conditions of life, as far as we know, have remained absolutely uniform.

@sen2077   The fact of little or no modification having been effected since the glacial period, would have been of some avail against those who believe in an innate and necessary law of development, but is powerless against the doctrine of natural selection or the survival of the fittest, which implies that when variations or individual differences of a beneficial nature happen to arise, these will be preserved, but this will be effected only under certain favourable circumstances.

@sen2079   If both have become fitted for slightly different habits of life or conditions, they might live together, and if we lay on one side polymorphic species, in which the variability seems to be of a peculiar nature, and all mere temporary variations, such as size, albinism, etc., the more permanent varieties are generally found, as far as I can discover, inhabiting distinct stations, such as high land or low land, dry or moist districts.

@sen2081   Bronn also insists that distinct species never differ from each other in single characters, but in many parts, and he asks, how it always comes that many parts of the organisation should have been modified at the same time through variation and natural selection?

@sen2083   The most striking modifications, excellently adapted for some purpose, might, as was formerly remarked, be acquired by successive variations, if slight, first in one part and then in another, and as they would be transmitted all together, they would appear to us as if they had been simultaneously developed.

@sen2084   The best answer, however, to the above objection is afforded by those domestic races which have been modified, chiefly through man's power of selection, for some special purpose.

@sen2086   Their whole frames, and even their mental characteristics, have been modified, but if we could trace each step in the history of their transformation--and the latter steps can be traced--we should not see great and simultaneous changes, but first one part and then another slightly modified and improved.

@sen2098   In the second place, it should always be borne in mind that when one part is modified, so will be other parts, through certain dimly seen causes, such as an increased or diminished flow of nutriment to a part, mutual pressure, an early developed part affecting one subsequently developed, and so forth--as well as through other causes which lead to the many mysterious cases of correlation, which we do not in the least understand.

@sen2110   With respect to plants, to which on account of Nageli's essay I shall confine myself in the following remarks, it will be admitted that the flowers of the orchids present a multitude of curious structures, which a few years ago would have been considered as mere morphological differences without any special function, but they are now known to be of the highest importance for the fertilisation of the species through the aid of insects, and have probably been gained through natural selection.

@sen2113   These positions seem at first purely morphological, or of no physiological signification, but Dr Hooker informs me that within the same ovarium the upper ovules alone in some cases, and in others the lower ones alone are fertilised, and he suggests that this probably depends on the direction in which the pollen-tubes enter the ovarium.

@sen2161   For the best definition which has ever been given of a high standard of organisation, is the degree to which the parts have been specialised or differentiated, and natural selection tends towards this end, inasmuch as the parts are thus enabled to perform their functions more efficiently.

@sen2182   By this process long-continued, which exactly corresponds with what I have called unconscious selection by man, combined, no doubt, in a most important manner with the inherited effects of the increased use of parts, it seems to me almost certain that an ordinary hoofed quadruped might be converted into a giraffe.

@sen2184   One is that the increased size of the body would obviously require an increased supply of food, and he considers it as "very problematical whether the disadvantages thence arising would not, in times of scarcity, more than counterbalance the advantages., But as the giraffe does actually exist in large numbers in Africa, and as some of the largest antelopes in the world, taller than an ox, abound there, why should we doubt that, as far as size is concerned, intermediate gradations could formerly have existed there, subjected as now to severe dearths.

@sen2191   Mr Mivart then asks, [and this is his second objection], if natural selection be so potent, and if high browsing be so great an advantage, why has not any other hoofed quadruped acquired a long neck and lofty stature, besides the giraffe, and, in a lesser degree, the camel, guanaco and macrauchenia?

@sen2194   In every meadow in England, in which trees grow, we see the lower branches trimmed or planed to an exact level by the browsing of the horses or cattle, and what advantage would it be, for instance, to sheep, if kept there, to acquire slightly longer necks?

@sen2197   Why, in other quarters of the world, various animals belonging to this same order have not acquired either an elongated neck or a proboscis, cannot be distinctly answered, but it is as unreasonable to expect a distinct answer to such a question as why some event in the history of mankind did not occur in one country while it did in another.

@sen2207   For instance, if the number of individuals existing in a country is determined chiefly through destruction by beasts of prey--by external or internal parasites, etc.--as seems often to be the case, then natural selection will be able to do little, or will be greatly retarded, in modifying any particular structure for obtaining food.

@sen2316   We thus see that the first stages of the transit of the eye from one side of the head to the other, which Mr Mivart considers would be injurious, may be attributed to the habit, no doubt beneficial to the individual and to the species, of endeavouring to look upward with both eyes, while resting on one side at the bottom.

@sen2317   We may also attribute to the inherited effects of use the fact of the mouth in several kinds of flat-fish being bent towards the lower surface, with the jaw bones stronger and more effective on this, the eyeless side of the head, than on the other, for the sake, as Dr Traquair supposes, of feeding with ease on the ground.

@sen2318   Disuse, on the other hand, will account for the less developed condition of the whole inferior half of the body, including the lateral fins, though Yarrel thinks that the reduced size of these fins is advantageous to the fish, as "there is so much less room for their action than with the larger fins above., Perhaps the lesser number of teeth in the proportion of four to seven in the upper halves of the two jaws of the plaice, to twenty-five to thirty in the lower halves, may likewise be accounted for by disuse.

@sen2319   From the colourless state of the ventral surface of most fishes and of many other animals, we may reasonably suppose that the absence of colour in flat-fish on the side, whether it be the right or left, which is under-most, is due to the exclusion of light.

@sen2352   The Echinodermata, [star-fishes, sea-urchins, etc.], are furnished with remarkable organs, called pedicellariae, which consist, when well developed, of a tridactyle forceps--that is, of one formed of three serrated arms, neatly fitting together and placed on the summit of a flexible stem, moved by muscles.

@sen2355   With respect to these organs, Mr Mivart, as on so many previous occasions, asks, "What would be the utility of the FIRST RUDIMENTARY BEGINNINGS of such structures, and how could such insipient buddings have ever preserved the life of a single Echinus, He adds, "not even the SUDDEN development of the snapping action would have been beneficial without the freely movable stalk, nor could the latter have been efficient without the snapping jaws, yet no minute, nearly indefinite variations could simultaneously evolve these complex co-ordinations of structure, to deny this seems to do no less than to affirm a startling paradox., Paradoxical as this may appear to Mr Mivart, tridactyle forcepses, immovably fixed at the base, but capable of a snapping action, certainly exist on some star-fishes, and this is intelligible if they serve, at least in part, as a means of defence.

@sen2360   This may be inferred from their manner of development in the individual, as well as from a long and perfect series of gradations in different species and genera, from simple granules to ordinary spines, to perfect tridactyle pedicellariae.

@sen2366   It is generally admitted that the ordinary spines serve as a protection, and if so, there can be no reason to doubt that those furnished with serrated and movable branches likewise serve for the same purpose, and they would thus serve still more effectively as soon as by meeting together they acted as a prehensile or snapping apparatus.

@sen2375   In one species observed by me, all the avicularia on the same branch often moved simultaneously backwards and forwards, with the lower jaw widely open, through an angle of about 90 degrees, in the course of five seconds, and their movement caused the whole polyzoary to tremble.

@sen2377   Mr Mivart adduces this case, chiefly on account of the supposed difficulty of organs, namely the avicularia of the Polyzoa and the pedicellariae of the Echinodermata, which he considers as "essentially similar, having been developed through natural selection in widely distinct divisions of the animal kingdom.

@sen2384   In the first and simplest stage, the terminal segment of a limb shuts down either on the square summit of the broad penultimate segment, or against one whole side, and is thus enabled to catch hold of an object, but the limb still serves as an organ of locomotion.

@sen2390   In one species examined by me the vibracula were slightly curved and serrated along the outer margin, and all of them on the same polyzoary often moved simultaneously, so that, acting like long oars, they swept a branch rapidly across the object-glass of my microscope.

@sen2394   It is not easy to imagine two objects more widely different in appearance than a bristle or vibraculum, and an avicularium like the head of a bird, yet they are almost certainly homologous and have been developed from the same common source, namely a zooid with its cell.

@sen2397   The vibracula may have been directly developed from the lips of the cells, without having passed through the avicularian stage, but it seems more probable that they have passed through this stage, as during the early stages of the transformation, the other parts of the cell, with the included zooid, could hardly have disappeared at once.

@sen2399   This view of the development of the vibracula, if trustworthy, is interesting, for supposing that all the species provided with avicularia had become extinct, no one with the most vivid imagination would ever have thought that the vibracula had originally existed as part of an organ, resembling a bird's head, or an irregular box or hood.

@sen2400   It is interesting to see two such widely different organs developed from a common origin, and as the movable lip of the cell serves as a protection to the zooid, there is no difficulty in believing that all the gradations, by which the lip became converted first into the lower mandible of an avicularium, and then into an elongated bristle, likewise served as a protection in different ways and under different circumstances.

@sen2402   With respect to the former, he says, "The explanation of their ORIGIN is deemed thoroughly unsatisfactory--utterly insufficient to explain the incipient, infinitesimal beginnings of structures which are of utility only when they are considerably developed., As I have fully treated this subject in another work, I will here give only a few details on one alone of the most striking peculiarities of the flowers of orchids, namely, their pollinia.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2403   A pollinium, when highly developed, consists of a mass of pollen-grains, affixed to an elastic foot-stalk or caudicle, and this to a little mass of extremely viscid matter.

@sen2405   In some orchids there is no caudicle to the pollen-masses, and the grains are merely tied together by fine threads, but as these are not confined to orchids, they need not here be considered, yet I may mention that at the base of the orchidaceous series, in Cypripedium, we can see how the threads were probably first developed.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2408   With respect to the second chief peculiarity, namely, the little mass of viscid matter attached to the end of the caudicle, a long series of gradations can be specified, each of plain service to the plant.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2410   Now, in certain orchids similar viscid matter is secreted, but in much larger quantities by one alone of the three stigmas, and this stigma, perhaps in consequence of the copious secretion, is rendered sterile.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2412   From this simple condition, which differs but little from that of a multitude of common flowers, there are endless gradations--to species in which the pollen-mass terminates in a very short, free caudicle--to others in which the caudicle becomes firmly attached to the viscid matter, with the sterile stigma itself much modified.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2414   He who will carefully examine the flowers of orchids for himself will not deny the existence of the above series of gradations--from a mass of pollen-grains merely tied together by threads, with the stigma differing but little from that of the ordinary flowers, to a highly complex pollinium, admirably adapted for transportal by insects, nor will he deny that all the gradations in the several species are admirably adapted in relation to the general structure of each flower for its fertilisation by different insects.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2415   In this, and in almost every other case, the enquiry may be pushed further backwards, and it may be asked how did the stigma of an ordinary flower become viscid, but as we do not know the full history of any one group of beings, it is as useless to ask, as it is hopeless to attempt answering, such questions.

@sen2417   These can be arranged in a long series, from those which simply twine round a support, to those which I have called leaf-climbers, and to those provided with tendrils.

@sen2418   In these two latter classes the stems have generally, but not always, lost the power of twining, though they retain the power of revolving, which the tendrils likewise possess.

@sen2420   But in ascending the series from simple twiners to leaf-climbers, an important quality is added, namely sensitiveness to a touch, by which means the foot-stalks of the leaves or flowers, or these modified and converted into tendrils, are excited to bend round and clasp the touching object.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2422   For instance, it is clearly a great advantage to a twining plant to become a leaf-climber, and it is probable that every twiner which possessed leaves with long foot-stalks would have been developed into a leaf-climber, if the foot-stalks had possessed in any slight degree the requisite sensitiveness to a touch.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2423   As twining is the simplest means of ascending a support, and forms the basis of our series, it may naturally be asked how did plants acquire this power in an incipient degree, afterwards to be improved and increased through natural selection.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2424   The power of twining depends, firstly, on the stems while young being extremely flexible, [but this is a character common to many plants which are not climbers], and, secondly, on their continually bending to all points of the compass, one after the other in succession, in the same order.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2428   As in many widely separated families of plants, single species and single genera possess the power of revolving, and have thus become twiners, they must have independently acquired it, and cannot have inherited it from a common progenitor.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2429   Hence, I was led to predict that some slight tendency to a movement of this kind would be found to be far from uncommon with plants which did not climb, and that this had afforded the basis for natural selection to work on and improve.
              " (quote is found in) part 53 of Darwin.dat

@sen2430   When I made this prediction, I knew of only one imperfect case, namely, of the young flower-peduncles of a Maurandia which revolved slightly and irregularly, like the stems of twining plants, but without making any use of this habit.
              " (quote is found in) part 54 of Darwin.dat

@sen2431   Soon afterwards Fritz Muller discovered that the young stems of an Alisma and of a Linum--plants which do not climb and are widely separated in the natural system--revolved plainly, though irregularly, and he states that he has reason to suspect that this occurs with some other plants.
              " (quote is found in) part 54 of Darwin.dat

@sen2433   Nevertheless we can see that if the stems of these plants had been flexible, and if under the conditions to which they are exposed it had profited them to ascend to a height, then the habit of slightly and irregularly revolving might have been increased and utilised through natural selection, until they had become converted into well-developed twining species.

@sen2434   With respect to the sensitiveness of the foot-stalks of the leaves and flowers, and of tendrils, nearly the same remarks are applicable as in the case of the revolving movements of twining plants.

@sen2435   As a vast number of species, belonging to widely distinct groups, are endowed with this kind of sensitiveness, it ought to be found in a nascent condition in many plants which have not become climbers.

@sen2437   Morren found in several species of Oxalis that the leaves and their foot-stalks moved, especially after exposure to a hot sun, when they were gently and repeatedly touched, or when the plant was shaken.

              " (quote is found in) part 54 of Darwin.dat

@sen2439   It is a more important fact that according to the high authority of Hofmeister, the young shoots and leaves of all plants move after being shaken, and with climbing plants it is, as we know, only during the early stages of growth that the foot-stalks and tendrils are sensitive.

@sen2441   But plants possess, in obedience to various stimuli, powers of movement, which are of manifest importance to them, for instance, towards and more rarely from the light--in opposition to, and more rarely in the direction of, the attraction of gravity.

@sen2445   It is, however, probable, from reasons which I have assigned in my memoir, that this will have occurred only with plants which had already acquired the power of revolving, and had thus become twiners.

@sen2446   I have already endeavoured to explain how plants became twiners, namely, by the increase of a tendency to slight and irregular revolving movements, which were at first of no use to them, this movement, as well as that due to a touch or shake, being the incidental result of the power of moving, gained for other and beneficial purposes.

@sen2611   No doubt they occasionally do make an attack, and are then beaten, and if not cured, they are destroyed, so that habit and some degree of selection have probably concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs.

@sen2612   On the other hand, young chickens have lost wholly by habit, that fear of the dog and cat which no doubt was originally instinctive in them, for I am informed by Captain Hutton that the young chickens of the parent stock, the Gallus bankiva, when reared in India under a hen, are at first excessively wild.

@sen2614   It is not that chickens have lost all fear, but fear only of dogs and cats, for if the hen gives the danger chuckle they will run, [more especially young turkeys], from under her and conceal themselves in the surrounding grass or thickets, and this is evidently done for the instinctive purpose of allowing, as we see in wild ground-birds, their mother to fly away.

@sen2620   I will select only three, namely, the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay her eggs in other birds' nests, the slave-making instinct of certain ants, and the cell-making power of the hive-bee, these two latter instincts have generally and justly been ranked by naturalists as the most wonderful of all known instincts.
              " (quote is found in) part 58 of Darwin.dat

@sen2622   It is supposed by some naturalists that the more immediate cause of the instinct of the cuckoo is that she lays her eggs, not daily, but at intervals of two or three days, so that, if she were to make her own nest and sit on her own eggs, those first laid would have to be left for some time unincubated or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages in the same nest.

@sen2625   It has been both asserted and denied that the American cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds' nests, but I have lately heard from Dr Merrill, of Iowa, that he once found in Illinois a young cuckoo, together with a young jay in the nest of a blue jay, [Garrulus cristatus], and as both were nearly full feathered, there could be no mistake in their identification.

@sen2626   I could also give several instances of various birds which have been known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds' nests.

@sen2628   If the old bird profited by this occasional habit through being enabled to emigrate earlier or through any other cause, or if the young were made more vigorous by advantage being taken of the mistaken instinct of another species than when reared by their own mother, encumbered as she could hardly fail to be by having eggs and young of different ages at the same time, then the old birds or the fostered young would gain an advantage.

@sen2629   And analogy would lead us to believe that the young thus reared would be apt to follow by inheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother, and in their turn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds' nests, and thus be more successful in rearing their young.

@sen2635   Until recently the instincts of the European and of the non-parasitic American cuckoo alone were known, now, owing to Mr Ramsay's observations, we have learned something about three Australian species, which lay their eggs in other birds' nests.
              " (quote is found in) part 58 of Darwin.dat

@sen2636   The chief points to be referred to are three, first, that the common cuckoo, with rare exceptions, lays only one egg in a nest, so that the large and voracious young bird receives ample food.
              " (quote is found in) part 58 of Darwin.dat

@sen2639   Thirdly, that the young cuckoo, soon after birth, has the instinct, the strength and a properly shaped back for ejecting its foster-brothers, which then perish from cold and hunger.

@sen2643   Now, if it had been of an advantage to this species to have laid eggs even smaller than those now laid, so as to have deceived certain foster-parents, as is more probable, to have been hatched within a shorter period, [for it is asserted that there is a relation between the size of eggs and the period of their incubation], then there is no difficulty in believing that a race or species might have been formed which would have laid smaller and smaller eggs, for these would have been more safely hatched and reared.
              " (quote is found in) part 58 of Darwin.dat

@sen2645   The European species apparently manifests some tendency towards a similar instinct, but not rarely departs from it, as is shown by her laying her dull and pale-coloured eggs in the nest of the hedge-warbler with bright greenish-blue eggs.

@sen2647   The eggs of the Australian bronze cuckoo vary, according to Mr Ramsay, to an extraordinary degree in colour, so that in this respect, as well as in size, natural selection might have secured and fixed any advantageous variation.

@sen2648   In the case of the European cuckoo, the offspring of the foster-parents are commonly ejected from the nest within three days after the cuckoo is hatched, and as the latter at this age is in a most helpless condition, Mr Gould was formerly inclined to believe that the act of ejection was performed by the foster-parents themselves.
              " (quote is found in) part 58 of Darwin.dat

@sen2651   With respect to the means by which this strange and odious instinct was acquired, if it were of great importance for the young cuckoo, as is probably the case, to receive as much food as possible soon after birth, I can see no special difficulty in its having gradually acquired, during successive generations, the blind desire, the strength, and structure necessary for the work of ejection, for those cuckoos which had such habits and structure best developed would be the most securely reared.
              " (quote is found in) part 58 of Darwin.dat

@sen2652   The first step towards the acquisition of the proper instinct might have been mere unintentional restlessness on the part of the young bird, when somewhat advanced in age and strength, the habit having been afterwards improved, and transmitted to an earlier age.
              " (quote is found in) part 58 of Darwin.dat

@sen2653   I can see no more difficulty in this than in the unhatched young of other birds acquiring the instinct to break through their own shells, or than in young snakes acquiring in their upper jaws, as Owen has remarked, a transitory sharp tooth for cutting through the tough egg-shell.

@sen2654   For if each part is liable to individual variations at all ages, and the variations tend to be inherited at a corresponding or earlier age--propositions which cannot be disputed--then the instincts and structure of the young could be slowly modified as surely as those of the adult, and both cases must stand or fall together with the whole theory of natural selection.

@sen2676   This case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo, for these bees have not only had their instincts but their structure modified in accordance with their parasitic habits, for they do not possess the pollen-collecting apparatus which would have been indispensable if they had stored up food for their own young.

@sen2761   We hear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a recondite problem, and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold the greatest possible amount of honey, with the least possible consumption of precious wax in their construction.

@sen2762   It has been remarked that a skilful workman, with fitting tools and measures, would find it very difficult to make cells of wax of the true form, though this is effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive.

@sen2763   Granting whatever instincts you please, it seems at first quite inconceivable how they can make all the necessary angles and planes, or even perceive when they are correctly made.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2765   I was led to investigate this subject by Mr Waterhouse, who has shown that the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence of adjoining cells, and the following view may, perhaps, be considered only as a modification of his theory.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2767   At one end of a short series we have humble-bees, which use their old cocoons to hold honey, sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax, and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2768   At the other end of the series we have the cells of the hive-bee, placed in a double layer, each cell, as is well known, is an hexagonal prism, with the basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join an inverted pyramid, of three rhombs.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2771   The Melipona itself is intermediate in structure between the hive and humble bee, but more nearly related to the latter, it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells, in which the young are hatched, and, in addition, some large cells of wax for holding honey.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2773   But the important point to notice is, that these cells are always made at that degree of nearness to each other that they would have intersected or broken into each other if the spheres had been completed, but this is never permitted, the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax between the spheres which thus tend to intersect.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2775   When one cell rests on three other cells, which, from the spheres being nearly of the same size, is very frequently and necessarily the case, the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid, and this pyramid, as Huber has remarked, is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided pyramidal base of the cell of the hive-bee.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2777   It is obvious that the Melipona saves wax, and what is more important, labour, by this manner of building, for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double, but are of the same thickness as the outer spherical portions, and yet each flat portion forms a part of two cells.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2778   Reflecting on this case, it occurred to me that if the Melipona had made its spheres at some given distance from each other, and had made them of equal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer, the resulting structure would have been as perfect as the comb of the hive-bee.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2779   Accordingly I wrote to Professor Miller, of Cambridge, and this geometer has kindly read over the following statement, drawn up from his information, and tells me that it is strictly correct:--
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2780   If a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed in two parallel layers, with the centre of each sphere at the distance of radius x sqrt, [2], or radius x 1.41421 [or at some lesser distance], from the centres of the six surrounding spheres in the same layer, and at the same distance from the centres of the adjoining spheres in the other and parallel layer, then, if planes of intersection between the several spheres in both layers be formed, there will result a double layer of hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal bases formed of three rhombs, and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonal prisms will have every angle identically the same with the best measurements which have been made of the cells of the hive-bee.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2781   But I hear from Professor Wyman, who has made numerous careful measurements, that the accuracy of the workmanship of the bee has been greatly exaggerated, so much so, that whatever the typical form of the cell may be, it is rarely, if ever, realised.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2782   Hence we may safely conclude that, if we could slightly modify the instincts already possessed by the Melipona, and in themselves not very wonderful, this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect as that of the hive-bee.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2783   We must suppose the Melipona to have the power of forming her cells truly spherical, and of equal sizes, and this would not be very surprising, seeing that she already does so to a certain extent, and seeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows many insects make in wood, apparently by turning round on a fixed point.
              " (quote is found in) part 61 of Darwin.dat

@sen2784   We must suppose the Melipona to arrange her cells in level layers, as she already does her cylindrical cells, and we must further suppose, and this is the greatest difficulty, that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance to stand from her fellow-labourers when several are making their spheres, but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance, that she always describes her spheres so as to intersect to a certain extent, and then she unites the points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces.

@sen2785   By such modifications of instincts which in themselves are not very wonderful--hardly more wonderful than those which guide a bird to make its nest--I believe that the hive-bee has acquired, through natural selection, her inimitable architectural powers.

@sen2787   Following the example of Mr Tegetmeier, I separated two combs, and put between them a long, thick, rectangular strip of wax, the bees instantly began to excavate minute circular pits in it, and as they deepened these little pits, they made them wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins, appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere, and of about the diameter of a cell.

@sen2796   Considering how flexible thin wax is, I do not see that there is any difficulty in the bees, whilst at work on the two sides of a strip of wax, perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the proper thinness, and then stopping their work.

@sen2797   In ordinary combs it has appeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactly the same rate from the opposite sides, for I have noticed half-completed rhombs at the base of a just-commenced cell, which were slightly concave on one side, where I suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly, and convex on the opposed side where the bees had worked less quickly.

@sen2798   In one well-marked instance, I put the comb back into the hive, and allowed the bees to go on working for a short time, and again examined the cell, and I found that the rhombic plate had been completed, and had become PERFECTLY FLAT, it was absolutely impossible, from the extreme thinness of the little plate, that they could have effected this by gnawing away the convex side, and I suspect that the bees in such cases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warm wax, [which as I have tried is easily done], into its proper intermediate plane, and thus flatten it.

@sen2799   From the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can see that, if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax, they could make their cells of the proper shape, by standing at the proper distance from each other, by excavating at the same rate, and by endeavouring to make equal spherical hollows, but never allowing the spheres to break into each other.
              " (quote is found in) part 62 of Darwin.dat

@sen2800   Now bees, as may be clearly seen by examining the edge of a growing comb, do make a rough, circumferential wall or rim all round the comb, and they gnaw this away from the opposite sides, always working circularly as they deepen each cell.
              " (quote is found in) part 62 of Darwin.dat

@sen2801   They do not make the whole three-sided pyramidal base of any one cell at the same time, but only that one rhombic plate which stands on the extreme growing margin, or the two plates, as the case may be, and they never complete the upper edges of the rhombic plates, until the hexagonal walls are commenced.

@sen2803   Huber's statement, that the very first cell is excavated out of a little parallel-sided wall of wax, is not, as far as I have seen, strictly correct, the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax, but I will not here enter on details.

@sen2804   We see how important a part excavation plays in the construction of the cells, but it would be a great error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of wax in the proper position--that is, along the plane of intersection between two adjoining spheres.

@sen2809   We shall understand how they work, by supposing masons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement, and then to begin cutting it away equally on both sides near the ground, till a smooth, very thin wall is left in the middle, the masons always piling up the cut-away cement, and adding fresh cement on the summit of the ridge.

@sen2811   From all the cells, both those just commenced and those completed, being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax, the bees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicate hexagonal walls.

@sen2812   These walls, as Professor Miller has kindly ascertained for me, vary greatly in thickness, being, on an average of twelve measurements made near the border of the comb, 1/352 of an inch in thickness, whereas the basal rhomboidal plates are thicker, nearly in the proportion of three to two, having a mean thickness, from twenty-one measurements, of 1/229 of an inch.

@sen2814   It seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how the cells are made, that a multitude of bees all work together, one bee after working a short time at one cell going to another, so that, as Huber has stated, a score of individuals work even at the commencement of the first cell.

@sen2815   I was able practically to show this fact, by covering the edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell, or the extreme margin of the circumferential rim of a growing comb, with an extremely thin layer of melted vermilion wax, and I invariably found that the colour was most delicately diffused by the bees--as delicately as a painter could have done it with his brush--by atoms of the coloured wax having been taken from the spot on which it had been placed, and worked into the growing edges of the cells all round.

@sen2816   The work of construction seems to be a sort of balance struck between many bees, all instinctively standing at the same relative distance from each other, all trying to sweep equal spheres, and then building up, or leaving ungnawed, the planes of intersection between these spheres.

@sen2817   It was really curious to note in cases of difficulty, as when two pieces of comb met at an angle, how often the bees would pull down and rebuild in different ways the same cell, sometimes recurring to a shape which they had at first rejected.

@sen2818   When bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positions for working--for instance, on a slip of wood, placed directly under the middle of a comb growing downwards, so that the comb has to be built over one face of the slip--in this case the bees can lay the foundations of one wall of a new hexagon, in its strictly proper place, projecting beyond the other completed cells.
              " (quote is found in) part 62 of Darwin.dat

@sen2819   It suffices that the bees should be enabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each other and from the walls of the last completed cells, and then, by striking imaginary spheres, they can build up a wall intermediate between two adjoining spheres, but, as far as I have seen, they never gnaw away and finish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell and of the adjoining cells has been built.

@sen2820   This capacity in bees of laying down under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper place between two just-commenced cells, is important, as it bears on a fact, which seems at first subversive of the foregoing theory, namely, that the cells on the extreme margin of wasp-combs are sometimes strictly hexagonal, but I have not space here to enter on this subject.
              " (quote is found in) part 62 of Darwin.dat

@sen2821   Nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect, [as in the case of a queen-wasp], making hexagonal cells, if she were to work alternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced at the same time, always standing at the proper relative distance from the parts of the cells just begun, sweeping spheres or cylinders, and building up intermediate planes.

@sen2822   As natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slight modifications of structure or instinct, each profitable to the individual under its conditions of life, it may reasonably be asked, how a long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts, all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction, could have profited the progenitors of the hive-bee?
              " (quote is found in) part 62 of Darwin.dat

@sen2823   I think the answer is not difficult, cells constructed like those of the bee or the wasp gain in strength, and save much in labour and space, and in the materials of which they are constructed.
              " (quote is found in) part 62 of Darwin.dat

@sen2828   Of course the success of the species may be dependent on the number of its enemies, or parasites, or on quite distinct causes, and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey which the bees can collect.
              " (quote is found in) part 62 of Darwin.dat

@sen2829   But let us suppose that this latter circumstance determined, as it probably often has determined, whether a bee allied to our humble-bees could exist in large numbers in any country, and let us further suppose that the community lived through the winter, and consequently required a store of honey, there can in this case be no doubt that it would be an advantage to our imaginary humble-bee if a slight modification of her instincts led her to make her waxen cells near together, so as to intersect a little, for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells would save some little labour and wax.
              " (quote is found in) part 62 of Darwin.dat

@sen2830   Hence, it would continually be more and more advantageous to our humble-bees, if they were to make their cells more and more regular, nearer together, and aggregated into a mass, like the cells of the Melipona, for in this case a large part of the bounding surface of each cell would serve to bound the adjoining cells, and much labour and wax would be saved.
              " (quote is found in) part 62 of Darwin.dat

@sen2831   Again, from the same cause, it would be advantageous to the Melipona, if she were to make her cells closer together, and more regular in every way than at present, for then, as we have seen, the spherical surfaces would wholly disappear and be replaced by plane surfaces, and the Melipona would make a comb as perfect as that of the hive-bee.
              " (quote is found in) part 62 of Darwin.dat

@sen2832   Beyond this stage of perfection in architecture, natural selection could not lead, for the comb of the hive-bee, as far as we can see, is absolutely perfect in economising labour and wax.

@sen2833   Thus, as I believe, the most wonderful of all known instincts, that of the hive-bee, can be explained by natural selection having taken advantage of numerous, successive, slight modifications of simpler instincts, natural selection having, by slow degrees, more and more perfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance from each other in a double layer, and to build up and excavate the wax along the planes of intersection.

@sen2834   The bees, of course, no more knowing that they swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other, than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms and of the basal rhombic plates, the motive power of the process of natural selection having been the construction of cells of due strength and of the proper size and shape for the larvae, this being effected with the greatest possible economy of labour and wax, that individual swarm which thus made the best cells with least labour, and least waste of honey in the secretion of wax, having succeeded best, and having transmitted their newly-acquired economical instincts to new swarms, which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeeding in the struggle for existence.

@sen2835   OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION AS APPLIED TO INSTINCTS, NEUTER AND STERILE INSECTS.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2836   It has been objected to the foregoing view of the origin of instincts that "the variations of structure and of instinct must have been simultaneous and accurately adjusted to each other, as a modification in the one without an immediate corresponding change in the other would have been fatal., The force of this objection rests entirely on the assumption that the changes in the instincts and structure are abrupt.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2838   Now what special difficulty would there be in natural selection preserving all the slight individual variations in the shape of the beak, which were better and better adapted to break open the seeds, until a beak was formed, as well constructed for this purpose as that of the nuthatch, at the same time that habit, or compulsion, or spontaneous variations of taste, led the bird to become more and more of a seed-eater?
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2839   In this case the beak is supposed to be slowly modified by natural selection, subsequently to, but in accordance with, slowly changing habits or taste, but let the feet of the titmouse vary and grow larger from correlation with the beak, or from any other unknown cause, and it is not improbable that such larger feet would lead the bird to climb more and more until it acquired the remarkable climbing instinct and power of the nuthatch.

@sen2842   Some birds build their nests of mud, believed to be moistened with saliva, and one of the swifts of North America makes its nest, [as I have seen], of sticks agglutinated with saliva, and even with flakes of this substance.

@sen2843   Is it then very improbable that the natural selection of individual swifts, which secreted more and more saliva, should at last produce a species with instincts leading it to neglect other materials and to make its nest exclusively of inspissated saliva?
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2846   No doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposed to the theory of natural selection--cases, in which we cannot see how an instinct could have originated, cases, in which no intermediate gradations are known to exist, cases of instincts of such trifling importance, that they could hardly have been acted on by natural selection, cases of instincts almost identically the same in animals so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot account for their similarity by inheritance from a common progenitor, and consequently must believe that they were independently acquired through natural selection.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2847   I will not here enter on these several cases, but will confine myself to one special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to the whole theory.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2848   I allude to the neuters or sterile females in insect communities, for these neuters often differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the males and fertile females, and yet, from being sterile, they cannot propagate their kind.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2850   How the workers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty, but not much greater than that of any other striking modification of structure, for it can be shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state of nature occasionally become sterile, and if such insects had been social, and it had been profitable to the community that a number should have been annually born capable of work, but incapable of procreation, I can see no especial difficulty in this having been effected through natural selection.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2854   If a working ant or other neuter insect had been an ordinary animal, I should have unhesitatingly assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquired through natural selection, namely, by individuals having been born with slight profitable modifications, which were inherited by the offspring, and that these again varied and again were selected, and so onwards.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2856   It may well be asked how it is possible to reconcile this case with the theory of natural selection?
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2857   First, let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances, both in our domestic productions and in those in a state of nature, of all sorts of differences of inherited structure which are correlated with certain ages and with either sex.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2858   We have differences correlated not only with one sex, but with that short period when the reproductive system is active, as in the nuptial plumage of many birds, and in the hooked jaws of the male salmon.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2860   Hence, I can see no great difficulty in any character becoming correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of insect communities, the difficulty lies in understanding how such correlated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulated by natural selection.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2861   This difficulty, though appearing insuperable, is lessened, as I believe, disappears, when it is remembered that selection may be applied to the family, as well as to the individual, and may thus gain the desired end.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2864   Such faith may be placed in the power of selection that a breed of cattle, always yielding oxen with extraordinarily long horns, could, it is probable, be formed by carefully watching which individual bulls and cows, when matched, produced oxen with the longest horns, and yet no one ox would ever have propagated its kind.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2866   Verlot, some varieties of the double annual stock, from having been long and carefully selected to the right degree, always produce a large proportion of seedlings bearing double and quite sterile flowers, but they likewise yield some single and fertile plants.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2868   As with the varieties of the stock, so with social insects, selection has been applied to the family, and not to the individual, for the sake of gaining a serviceable end.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2869   Hence, we may conclude that slight modifications of structure or of instinct, correlated with the sterile condition of certain members of the community, have proved advantageous, consequently the fertile males and females have flourished, and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency to produce sterile members with the same modifications.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2870   This process must have been repeated many times, until that prodigious amount of difference between the fertile and sterile females of the same species has been produced which we see in many social insects.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2871   But we have not as yet touched on the acme of the difficulty, namely, the fact that the neuters of several ants differ, not only from the fertile females and males, but from each other, sometimes to an almost incredible degree, and are thus divided into two or even three castes.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2872   The castes, moreover, do not generally graduate into each other, but are perfectly well defined, being as distinct from each other as are any two species of the same genus, or rather as any two genera of the same family.

@sen2873   Thus, in Eciton, there are working and soldier neuters, with jaws and instincts extraordinarily different, in Cryptocerus, the workers of one caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads, the use of which is quite unknown, in the Mexican Myrmecocystus, the workers of one caste never leave the nest, they are fed by the workers of another caste, and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes a sort of honey, supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides, or the domestic cattle as they may be called, which our European ants guard and imprison.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2874   It will indeed be thought that I have an overweening confidence in the principle of natural selection, when I do not admit that such wonderful and well-established facts at once annihilate the theory.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2875   In the simpler case of neuter insects all of one caste, which, as I believe, have been rendered different from the fertile males and females through natural selection, we may conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations, that the successive, slight, profitable modifications did not first arise in all the neuters in the same nest, but in some few alone, and that by the survival of the communities with females which produced most neuters having the advantageous modification, all the neuters ultimately came to be thus characterized.
              " (quote is found in) part 63 of Darwin.dat

@sen2876   According to this view we ought occasionally to find in the same nest neuter-insects, presenting gradations of structure, and this we do find, even not rarely, considering how few neuter-insects out of Europe have been carefully examined.

@sen2878   Smith has shown that the neuters of several British ants differ surprisingly from each other in size and sometimes in colour, and that the extreme forms can be linked together by individuals taken out of the same nest, I have myself compared perfect gradations of this kind.

@sen2882   Having carefully dissected several specimens of these workers, I can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in the smaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionately lesser size, and I fully believe, though I dare not assert so positively, that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli in an exactly intermediate condition.

@sen2884   I may digress by adding, that if the smaller workers had been the most useful to the community, and those males and females had been continually selected, which produced more and more of the smaller workers, until all the workers were in this condition, we should then have had a species of ant with neuters in nearly the same condition as those of Myrmica.
              " (quote is found in) part 64 of Darwin.dat

@sen2886   I may give one other case, so confidently did I expect occasionally to find gradations of important structures between the different castes of neuters in the same species, that I gladly availed myself of Mr F.
              " (quote is found in) part 64 of Darwin.dat

@sen2888   The reader will perhaps best appreciate the amount of difference in these workers by my giving, not the actual measurements, but a strictly accurate illustration, the difference was the same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house, of whom many were five feet four inches high, and many sixteen feet high, but we must in addition suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of three times as big as those of the smaller men, and jaws nearly five times as big.

@sen2894   With these facts before me, I believe that natural selection, by acting on the fertile ants or parents, could form a species which should regularly produce neuters, all of large size with one form of jaw, or all of small size with widely different jaws, or lastly, and this is the greatest difficulty, one set of workers of one size and structure, and simultaneously another set of workers of a different size and structure, a graduated series having first been formed, as in the case of the driver ant, and then the extreme forms having been produced in greater and greater numbers, through the survival of the parents which generated them, until none with an intermediate structure were produced.

@sen2914   For instance, we can understand, on the principle of inheritance, how it is that the thrush of tropical South America lines its nest with mud, in the same peculiar manner as does our British thrush, how it is that the Hornbills of Africa and India have the same extraordinary instinct of plastering up and imprisoning the females in a hole in a tree, with only a small hole left in the plaster through which the males feed them and their young when hatched, how it is that the male wrens, [Troglodytes], of North America, build "cock-nests, to roost in, like the males of our Kitty-wrens,--a habit wholly unlike that of any other known bird.

@sen2935   It is impossible to study the several memoirs and works of those two conscientious and admirable observers, Kolreuter and Gartner, who almost devoted their lives to this subject, without being deeply impressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility.

@sen2936   Kolreuter makes the rule universal, but then he cuts the knot, for in ten cases in which he found two forms, considered by most authors as distinct species, quite fertile together, he unhesitatingly ranks them as varieties.

@sen2939   He always compares the maximum number of seeds produced by two species when first crossed, and the maximum produced by their hybrid offspring, with the average number produced by both pure parent-species in a state of nature.

@sen2940   But causes of serious error here intervene, a plant, to be hybridised, must be castrated, and, what is often more important, must be secluded in order to prevent pollen being brought to it by insects from other plants.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2942   That these processes are often injurious to the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted, for Gartner gives in his table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated, and artificially fertilised with their own pollen, and, [excluding all cases such as the Leguminosae, in which there is an acknowledged difficulty in the manipulation], half of these twenty plants had their fertility in some degree impaired.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2943   Moreover, as Gartner repeatedly crossed some forms, such as the common red and blue pimpernels, [Anagallis arvensis and coerulea], which the best botanists rank as varieties, and found them absolutely sterile, we may doubt whether many species are really so sterile, when intercrossed, as he believed.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2944   It is certain, on the one hand, that the sterility of various species when crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly, and, on the other hand, that the fertility of pure species is so easily affected by various circumstances, that for all practical purposes it is most difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2946   It is also most instructive to compare--but I have not space here to enter on details--the evidence advanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtful forms should be ranked as species or varieties, with the evidence from fertility adduced by different hybridisers, or by the same observer from experiments made during different years.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2947   It can thus be shown that neither sterility nor fertility affords any certain distinction between species and varieties.

@sen2949   In regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations, though Gartner was enabled to rear some hybrids, carefully guarding them from a cross with either pure parent, for six or seven, and in one case for ten generations, yet he asserts positively that their fertility never increases, but generally decreases greatly and suddenly.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2950   With respect to this decrease, it may first be noticed that when any deviation in structure or constitution is common to both parents, this is often transmitted in an augmented degree to the offspring, and both sexual elements in hybrid plants are already affected in some degree.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2952   I have made so many experiments and collected so many facts, showing on the one hand that an occasional cross with a distinct individual or variety increases the vigour and fertility of the offspring, and on the other hand that very close interbreeding lessens their vigour and fertility, that I cannot doubt the correctness of this conclusion.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2953   Hybrids are seldom raised by experimentalists in great numbers, and as the parent-species, or other allied hybrids, generally grow in the same garden, the visits of insects must be carefully prevented during the flowering season, hence hybrids, if left to themselves, will generally be fertilised during each generation by pollen from the same flower, and this would probably be injurious to their fertility, already lessened by their hybrid origin.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2954   I am strengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedly made by Gartner, namely, that if even the less fertile hybrids be artificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind, their fertility, notwithstanding the frequent ill effects from manipulation, sometimes decidedly increases, and goes on increasing.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2955   Now, in the process of artificial fertilisation, pollen is as often taken by chance, [as I know from my own experience], from the anthers of another flower, as from the anthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised, so that a cross between two flowers, though probably often on the same plant, would be thus effected.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2956   Moreover, whenever complicated experiments are in progress, so careful an observer as Gartner would have castrated his hybrids, and this would have insured in each generation a cross with pollen from a distinct flower, either from the same plant or from another plant of the same hybrid nature.
              " (quote is found in) part 65 of Darwin.dat

@sen2957   And thus, the strange fact of an increase of fertility in the successive generations of ARTIFICIALLY FERTILISED hybrids, in contrast with those spontaneously self-fertilised, may, as I believe, be accounted for by too close interbreeding having been avoided.

@sen2978   Horticulturists raise large beds of the same hybrid, and such alone are fairly treated, for by insect agency the several individuals are allowed to cross freely with each other, and the injurious influence of close interbreeding is thus prevented.

@sen2982   It should, however, be borne in mind that, owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement, few experiments have been fairly tried, for instance, the canary-bird has been crossed with nine distinct species of finches, but, as not one of these breeds freely in confinement, we have no right to expect that the first crosses between them and the canary, or that their hybrids, should be perfectly fertile.

@sen3002   Finally, considering all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing of plants and animals, it may be concluded that some degree of sterility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is an extremely general result, but that it cannot, under our present state of knowledge, be considered as absolutely universal.

@sen3011   From this absolute zero of fertility, the pollen of different species applied to the stigma of some one species of the same genus, yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced, up to nearly complete or even quite complete fertility, and, as we have seen, in certain abnormal cases, even to an excess of fertility, beyond that which the plant's own pollen produces.

@sen3012   So in hybrids themselves, there are some which never have produced, and probably never would produce, even with the pollen of the pure parents, a single fertile seed, but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may be detected, by the pollen of one of the pure parent-species causing the flower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would have done, and the early withering of the flower is well known to be a sign of incipient fertilisation.

@sen3014   The hybrids raised from two species which are very difficult to cross, and which rarely produce any offspring, are generally very sterile, but the parallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross, and the sterility of the hybrids thus produced--two classes of facts which are generally confounded together--is by no means strict.

@sen3051   This latter statement is clearly proved by the difference in the result of reciprocal crosses between the same two species, for, according as the one species or the other is used as the father or the mother, there is generally some difference, and occasionally the widest possible difference, in the facility of effecting an union.

@sen3061   The foregoing rules and facts, on the other hand, appear to me clearly to indicate that the sterility, both of first crosses and of hybrids, is simply incidental or dependent on unknown differences in their reproductive systems, the differences being of so peculiar and limited a nature, that, in reciprocal crosses between the same two species, the male sexual element of the one will often freely act on the female sexual element of the other, but not in a reversed direction.

@sen3083   At one time it appeared to me probable, as it has to others, that the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids might have been slowly acquired through the natural selection of slightly lessened degrees of fertility, which, like any other variation, spontaneously appeared in certain individuals of one variety when crossed with those of another variety.

@sen3084   For it would clearly be advantageous to two varieties or incipient species if they could be kept from blending, on the same principle that, when man is selecting at the same time two varieties, it is necessary that he should keep them separate.

@sen3085   In the first place, it may be remarked that species inhabiting distinct regions are often sterile when crossed, now it could clearly have been of no advantage to such separated species to have been rendered mutually sterile, and consequently this could not have been effected through natural selection, but it may perhaps be argued, that, if a species was rendered sterile with some one compatriot, sterility with other species would follow as a necessary contingency.
              " (quote is found in) part 68 of Darwin.dat

@sen3086   In the second place, it is almost as much opposed to the theory of natural selection as to that of special creation, that in reciprocal crosses the male element of one form should have been rendered utterly impotent on a second form, while at the same time the male element of this second form is enabled freely to fertilise the first form, for this peculiar state of the reproductive system could hardly have been advantageous to either species.

@sen3087   In considering the probability of natural selection having come into action, in rendering species mutually sterile, the greatest difficulty will be found to lie in the existence of many graduated steps, from slightly lessened fertility to absolute sterility.

@sen3088   It may be admitted that it would profit an incipient species, if it were rendered in some slight degree sterile when crossed with its parent form or with some other variety, for thus fewer bastardised and deteriorated offspring would be produced to commingle their blood with the new species in process of formation.

@sen3089   But he who will take the trouble to reflect on the steps by which this first degree of sterility could be increased through natural selection to that high degree which is common with so many species, and which is universal with species which have been differentiated to a generic or family rank, will find the subject extraordinarily complex.

@sen3093   With sterile neuter insects we have reason to believe that modifications in their structure and fertility have been slowly accumulated by natural selection, from an advantage having been thus indirectly given to the community to which they belonged over other communities of the same species, but an individual animal not belonging to a social community, if rendered slightly sterile when crossed with some other variety, would not thus itself gain any advantage or indirectly give any advantage to the other individuals of the same variety, thus leading to their preservation.

@sen3096   It is here manifestly impossible to select the more sterile individuals, which have already ceased to yield seeds, so that this acme of sterility, when the germen alone is effected, cannot have been gained through selection, and from the laws governing the various grades of sterility being so uniform throughout the animal and vegetable kingdoms, we may infer that the cause, whatever it may be, is the same or nearly the same in all cases.

@sen3111   But a hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of its mother, it may therefore, before birth, as long as it is nourished within its mother's womb, or within the egg or seed produced by the mother, be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable, and consequently be liable to perish at an early period, more especially as all very young beings are eminently sensitive to injurious or unnatural conditions of life.

@sen3145   Several plants belonging to distinct orders present two forms, which exist in about equal numbers and which differ in no respect except in their reproductive organs, one form having a long pistil with short stamens, the other a short pistil with long stamens, the two having differently sized pollen-grains.

@sen3151   The infertility which may be observed in various dimorphic and trimorphic plants, when they are illegitimately fertilised, that is by pollen taken from stamens not corresponding in height with the pistil, differs much in degree, up to absolute and utter sterility, just in the same manner as occurs in crossing distinct species.

@sen3153   It is well known that if pollen of a distinct species be placed on the stigma of a flower, and its own pollen be afterwards, even after a considerable interval of time, placed on the same stigma, its action is so strongly prepotent that it generally annihilates the effect of the foreign pollen, so it is with the pollen of the several forms of the same species, for legitimate pollen is strongly prepotent over illegitimate pollen, when both are placed on the same stigma.

@sen3154   I ascertained this by fertilising several flowers, first illegitimately, and twenty-four hours afterwards legitimately, with pollen taken from a peculiarly coloured variety, and all the seedlings were similarly coloured, this shows that the legitimate pollen, though applied twenty-four hours subsequently, had wholly destroyed or prevented the action of the previously applied illegitimate pollen.

@sen3155   Again, as in making reciprocal crosses between the same two species, there is occasionally a great difference in the result, so the same thing occurs with trimorphic plants, for instance, the mid-styled form of Lythrum salicaria was illegitimately fertilised with the greatest ease by pollen from the longer stamens of the short-styled form, and yielded many seeds, but the latter form did not yield a single seed when fertilised by the longer stamens of the mid-styled form.

@sen3166   In the same manner as the sterility of hybrids does not always run parallel with the difficulty of making the first cross between the two parent-species, so that sterility of certain illegitimate plants was unusually great, while the sterility of the union from which they were derived was by no means great.

@sen3172   This will perhaps be made more fully apparent by an illustration, we may suppose that a botanist found two well-marked varieties, [and such occur], of the long-styled form of the trimorphic Lythrum salicaria, and that he determined to try by crossing whether they were specifically distinct.

@sen3176   The facts now given on dimorphic and trimorphic plants are important, because they show us, first, that the physiological test of lessened fertility, both in first crosses and in hybrids, is no safe criterion of specific distinction, secondly, because we may conclude that there is some unknown bond which connects the infertility of illegitimate unions with that of their illegitimate offspring, and we are led to extend the same view to first crosses and hybrids, thirdly, because we find, and this seems to me of especial importance, that two or three forms of the same species may exist and may differ in no respect whatever, either in structure or in constitution, relatively to external conditions, and yet be sterile when united in certain ways.
              " (quote is found in) part 70 of Darwin.dat

@sen3177   For we must remember that it is the union of the sexual elements of individuals of the same form, for instance, of two long-styled forms, which results in sterility, while it is the union of the sexual elements proper to two distinct forms which is fertile.

@sen3180   We may, however, infer as probable from the consideration of dimorphic and trimorphic plants, that the sterility of distinct species when crossed and of their hybrid progeny, depends exclusively on the nature of their sexual elements, and not on any difference in their structure or general constitution.

@sen3190   For when it is stated, for instance, that certain South American indigenous domestic dogs do not readily unite with European dogs, the explanation which will occur to everyone, and probably the true one, is that they are descended from aboriginally distinct species.

@sen3191   Nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic races, differing widely from each other in appearance, for instance, those of the pigeon, or of the cabbage, is a remarkable fact, more especially when we reflect how many species there are, which, though resembling each other most closely, are utterly sterile when intercrossed.

@sen3193   In the first place, it may be observed that the amount of external difference between two species is no sure guide to their degree of mutual sterility, so that similar differences in the case of varieties would be no sure guide.

@sen3195   Now the varying conditions to which domesticated animals and cultivated plants have been subjected, have had so little tendency towards modifying the reproductive system in a manner leading to mutual sterility, that we have good grounds for admitting the directly opposite doctrine of Pallas, namely, that such conditions generally eliminate this tendency, so that the domesticated descendants of species, which in their natural state probably would have been in some degree sterile when crossed, become perfectly fertile together.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3196   With plants, so far is cultivation from giving a tendency towards sterility between distinct species, that in several well-authenticated cases already alluded to, certain plants have been affected in an opposite manner, for they have become self-impotent, while still retaining the capacity of fertilising, and being fertilised by, other species.

@sen3197   If the Pallasian doctrine of the elimination of sterility through long-continued domestication be admitted, and it can hardly be rejected, it becomes in the highest degree improbable that similar conditions long-continued should likewise induce this tendency, though in certain cases, with species having a peculiar constitution, sterility might occasionally be thus caused.

@sen3198   Thus, as I believe, we can understand why, with domesticated animals, varieties have not been produced which are mutually sterile, and why with plants only a few such cases, immediately to be given, have been observed.

@sen3199   The real difficulty in our present subject is not, as it appears to me, why domestic varieties have not become mutually infertile when crossed, but why this has so generally occurred with natural varieties, as soon as they have been permanently modified in a sufficient degree to take rank as species.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3201   But we can see that species, owing to their struggle for existence with numerous competitors, will have been exposed during long periods of time to more uniform conditions, than have domestic varieties, and this may well make a wide difference in the result.

@sen3202   For we know how commonly wild animals and plants, when taken from their natural conditions and subjected to captivity, are rendered sterile, and the reproductive functions of organic beings which have always lived under natural conditions would probably in like manner be eminently sensitive to the influence of an unnatural cross.

@sen3203   Domesticated productions, on the other hand, which, as shown by the mere fact of their domestication, were not originally highly sensitive to changes in their conditions of life, and which can now generally resist with undiminished fertility repeated changes of conditions, might be expected to produce varieties, which would be little liable to have their reproductive powers injuriously affected by the act of crossing with other varieties which had originated in a like manner.

@sen3224   From the great difficulty of ascertaining the infertility of varieties in a state of nature, for a supposed variety, if proved to be infertile in any degree, would almost universally be ranked as a species, from man attending only to external characters in his domestic varieties, and from such varieties not having been exposed for very long periods to uniform conditions of life, from these several considerations we may conclude that fertility does not constitute a fundamental distinction between varieties and species when crossed.

@sen3228   Gartner, whose strong wish it was to draw a distinct line between species and varieties, could find very few, and, as it seems to me, quite unimportant differences between the so-called hybrid offspring of species, and the so-called mongrel offspring of varieties.

@sen3230   I shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3231   The most important distinction is, that in the first generation mongrels are more variable than hybrids, but Gartner admits that hybrids from species which have long been cultivated are often variable in the first generation, and I have myself seen striking instances of this fact.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3232   Gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied species are more variable than those from very distinct species, and this shows that the difference in the degree of variability graduates away.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3233   When mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for several generations, an extreme amount of variability in the offspring in both cases is notorious, but some few instances of both hybrids and mongrels long retaining a uniform character could be given.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3234   The variability, however, in the successive generations of mongrels is, perhaps, greater than in hybrids.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3236   For the parents of mongrels are varieties, and mostly domestic varieties, [very few experiments having been tried on natural varieties], and this implies that there has been recent variability, which would often continue and would augment that arising from the act of crossing.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3237   The slight variability of hybrids in the first generation, in contrast with that in the succeeding generations, is a curious fact and deserves attention.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3238   For it bears on the view which I have taken of one of the causes of ordinary variability, namely, that the reproductive system, from being eminently sensitive to changed conditions of life, fails under these circumstances to perform its proper function of producing offspring closely similar in all respects to the parent-form.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3239   Now, hybrids in the first generation are descended from species, [excluding those long cultivated], which have not had their reproductive systems in any way affected, and they are not variable, but hybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected, and their descendants are highly variable.
              " (quote is found in) part 71 of Darwin.dat

@sen3242   Thus Max Wichura doubts whether hybrids ever revert to their parent forms, and he experimented on uncultivated species of willows, while Naudin, on the other hand, insists in the strongest terms on the almost universal tendency to reversion in hybrids, and he experimented chiefly on cultivated plants.
              " (quote is found in) part 72 of Darwin.dat

@sen3243   Gartner further states that when any two species, although most closely allied to each other, are crossed with a third species, the hybrids are widely different from each other, whereas if two very distinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species, the hybrids do not differ much.
              " (quote is found in) part 72 of Darwin.dat

@sen3244   But this conclusion, as far as I can make out, is founded on a single experiment, and seems directly opposed to the results of several experiments made by Kolreuter.

@sen3246   On the other hand, the degrees and kinds of resemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents, more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species, follow, according to Gartner the same laws.
              " (quote is found in) part 72 of Darwin.dat

@sen3251   These several remarks are apparently applicable to animals, but the subject is here much complicated, partly owing to the existence of secondary sexual characters, but more especially owing to prepotency in transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in the other, both when one species is crossed with another and when one variety is crossed with another variety.
              " (quote is found in) part 72 of Darwin.dat

@sen3252   For instance, I think those authors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power over the horse, so that both the mule and the hinny resemble more closely the ass than the horse, but that the prepotency runs more strongly in the male than in the female ass, so that the mule, which is an offspring of the male ass and mare, is more like an ass than is the hinny, which is the offspring of the female-ass and stallion.

@sen3253   Much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact, that it is only with mongrels that the offspring are not intermediate in character, but closely resemble one of their parents, but this does sometimes occur with hybrids, yet I grant much less frequently than with mongrels.
              " (quote is found in) part 72 of Darwin.dat

@sen3254   Looking to the cases which I have collected of cross-bred animals closely resembling one parent, the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almost monstrous in their nature, and which have suddenly appeared--such as albinism, melanism, deficiency of tail or horns, or additional fingers and toes, and do not relate to characters which have been slowly acquired through selection.
              " (quote is found in) part 72 of Darwin.dat

@sen3255   A tendency to sudden reversions to the perfect character of either parent would, also, be much more likely to occur with mongrels, which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced and semi-monstrous in character, than with hybrids, which are descended from species slowly and naturally produced.
              " (quote is found in) part 72 of Darwin.dat

@sen3256   On the whole, I entirely agree with Dr Prosper Lucas, who, after arranging an enormous body of facts with respect to animals, comes to the conclusion that the laws of resemblance of the child to its parents are the same, whether the two parents differ little or much from each other, namely, in the union of individuals of the same variety, or of different varieties, or of distinct species.

@sen3273   This view is strongly supported by a parallelism of another kind, namely, that, firstly, slight changes in the conditions of life add to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings, and secondly, that the crossing of forms, which have been exposed to slightly different conditions of life, or which have varied, favours the size, vigour and fertility of their offspring.

@sen3275   The consideration of these facts on dimorphism, as well as of the results of reciprocal crosses, clearly leads to the conclusion that the primary cause of the sterility of crossed species is confined to differences in their sexual elements.

@sen3277   It is not surprising that the difficulty in crossing any two species, and the sterility of their hybrid offspring, should in most cases correspond, even if due to distinct causes, for both depend on the amount of difference between the species which are crossed.

@sen3278   Nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a first cross, and the fertility of the hybrids thus produced, and the capacity of being grafted together--though this latter capacity evidently depends on widely different circumstances--should all run, to a certain extent, parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms subjected to experiment, for systematic affinity includes resemblances of all kinds.

@sen3452   In order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upper and lower parts of the same formation, the deposit must have gone on continuously accumulating during a long period, sufficient for the slow process of modification, hence, the deposit must be a very thick one, and the species undergoing change must have lived in the same district throughout the whole time.

@sen3453   But we have seen that a thick formation, fossiliferous throughout its entire thickness, can accumulate only during a period of subsidence, and to keep the depth approximately the same, which is necessary that the same marine species may live on the same space, the supply of sediment must nearly counterbalance the amount of subsidence.

@sen3555   Mr Croll estimates that about sixty million years have elapsed since the Cambrian period, but this, judging from the small amount of organic change since the commencement of the Glacial epoch, appears a very short time for the many and great mutations of life, which have certainly occurred since the Cambrian formation, and the previous one hundred and forty million years can hardly be considered as sufficient for the development of the varied forms of life which already existed during the Cambrian period.

@sen3556   It is, however, probable, as Sir William Thompson insists, that the world at a very early period was subjected to more rapid and violent changes in its physical conditions than those now occurring, and such changes would have tended to induce changes at a corresponding rate in the organisms which then existed.

@sen3573   It does not seem probable that the most ancient beds have been quite worn away by denudation, or that their fossils have been wholly obliterated by metamorphic action, for if this had been the case we should have found only small remnants of the formations next succeeding them in age, and these would always have existed in a partially metamorphosed condition.

@sen3577   From the nature of the organic remains which do not appear to have inhabited profound depths, in the several formations of Europe and of the United States, and from the amount of sediment, miles in thickness, of which the formations are composed, we may infer that from first to last large islands or tracts of land, whence the sediment was derived, occurred in the neighbourhood of the now existing continents of Europe and North America.

@sen3714   This great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of life throughout the world, is explicable on the theory of natural selection.
              " (quote is found in) part 82 of Darwin.dat

@sen3715   New species are formed by having some advantage over older forms, and the forms, which are already dominant, or have some advantage over the other forms in their own country, give birth to the greatest number of new varieties or incipient species.
              " (quote is found in) part 82 of Darwin.dat

@sen3716   We have distinct evidence on this head, in the plants which are dominant, that is, which are commonest and most widely diffused, producing the greatest number of new varieties.
              " (quote is found in) part 82 of Darwin.dat

@sen3717   It is also natural that the dominant, varying and far-spreading species, which have already invaded, to a certain extent, the territories of other species, should be those which would have the best chance of spreading still further, and of giving rise in new countries to other new varieties and species.
              " (quote is found in) part 82 of Darwin.dat

@sen3718   The process of diffusion would often be very slow, depending on climatal and geographical changes, on strange accidents, and on the gradual acclimatization of new species to the various climates through which they might have to pass, but in the course of time the dominant forms would generally succeed in spreading and would ultimately prevail.

@sen3721   Thus, as it seems to me, the parallel, and, taken in a large sense, simultaneous, succession of the same forms of life throughout the world, accords well with the principle of new species having been formed by dominant species spreading widely and varying, the new species thus produced being themselves dominant, owing to their having had some advantage over their already dominant parents, as well as over other species, and again spreading, varying, and producing new forms.

@sen3722   The old forms which are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victorious forms, will generally be allied in groups, from inheriting some inferiority in common, and, therefore, as new and improved groups spread throughout the world, old groups disappear from the world, and the succession of forms everywhere tends to correspond both in their first appearance and final disappearance.

@sen3723   There is one other remark connected with this subject worth making.
              " (quote is found in) part 82 of Darwin.dat

@sen3724   I have given my reasons for believing that most of our great formations, rich in fossils, were deposited during periods of subsidence, and that blank intervals of vast duration, as far as fossils are concerned, occurred during the periods when the bed of the sea was either stationary or rising, and likewise when sediment was not thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains.

@sen3725   During these long and blank intervals I suppose that the inhabitants of each region underwent a considerable amount of modification and extinction, and that there was much migration from other parts of the world.

@sen3726   As we have reason to believe that large areas are affected by the same movement, it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formations have often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarter of the world, but we are very far from having any right to conclude that this has invariably been the case, and that large areas have invariably been affected by the same movements.

@sen3727   When two formations have been deposited in two regions during nearly, but not exactly, the same period, we should find in both, from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs, the same general succession in the forms of life, but the species would not exactly correspond, for there will have been a little more time in the one region than in the other for modification, extinction, and immigration.

@sen3729   Mr Prestwich, in his admirable Memoirs on the eocene deposits of England and France, is able to draw a close general parallelism between the successive stages in the two countries, but when he compares certain stages in England with those in France, although he finds in both a curious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the same genera, yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficult to account for considering the proximity of the two areas, unless, indeed, it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabited by distinct, but contemporaneous faunas.

@sen3764   These three families, together with the many extinct genera on the several lines of descent diverging from the parent form, [A], will form an order, for all will have inherited something in common from their ancient progenitor.

@sen3767   We must not, however, assume that divergence of character is a necessary contingency, it depends solely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seize on many and different places in the economy of nature.

@sen3768   Therefore it is quite possible, as we have seen in the case of some Silurian forms, that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to its slightly altered conditions of life, and yet retain throughout a vast period the same general characteristics.

@sen3770   All the many forms, extinct and recent, descended from, [A], make, as before remarked, one order, and this order, from the continued effects of extinction and divergence of character, has become divided into several sub-families and families, some of which are supposed to have perished at different periods, and some to have endured to the present day.
              " (quote is found in) part 83 of Darwin.dat

@sen3771   By looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms supposed to be embedded in the successive formations, were discovered at several points low down in the series, the three existing families on the uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other.
              " (quote is found in) part 83 of Darwin.dat

@sen3772   for instance, the genera a1, a10, were disinterred, these three families would be so closely linked together that they probably would have to be united into one great family, in nearly the same manner as has occurred with ruminants and certain pachyderms.
              " (quote is found in) part 83 of Darwin.dat

@sen3773   Yet he who objected to consider as intermediate the extinct genera, which thus link together the living genera of three families, would be partly justified, for they are intermediate, not directly, but only by a long and circuitous course through many widely different forms.

@sen3776   So again, if the three families formed of eight genera, [a14 to m14], on the uppermost line, be supposed to differ from each other by half-a-dozen important characters, then the families which existed at a period marked VI would certainly have differed from each other by a less number of characters, for they would at this early stage of descent have diverged in a less degree from their common progenitor.

@sen3780   All that we have a right to expect is, that those groups which have, within known geological periods, undergone much modification, should in the older formations make some slight approach to each other, so that the older members should differ less from each other in some of their characters than do the existing members of the same groups, and this by the concurrent evidence of our best palaeontologists is frequently the case.

@sen3784   Thus the species which lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are the modified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage, and are the parents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage, hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in character between the forms of life above and below.

@sen3937   The degrees of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the more dominant forms of life from one region into another having been more or less effectually prevented, at periods more or less remote--on the nature and number of the former immigrants--and on the action of the inhabitants on each other in leading to the preservation of different modifications, the relation of organism to organism in the struggle for life being, as I have already often remarked, the most important of all relations.

@sen3965   Hence, it seems to me, as it has to many other naturalists, that the view of each species having been produced in one area alone, and having subsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migration and subsistence under past and present conditions permitted, is the most probable.

@sen3971   If the existence of the same species at distant and isolated points of the earth's surface can in many instances be explained on the view of each species having migrated from a single birthplace, then, considering our ignorance with respect to former climatical and geographical changes, and to the various occasional means of transport, the belief that a single birthplace is the law seems to me incomparably the safest.

@sen3972   In discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time to consider a point equally important for us, namely, whether the several species of a genus which must on our theory all be descended from a common progenitor, can have migrated, undergoing modification during their migration from some one area.

@sen3973   when most of the species inhabiting one region are different from those of another region, though closely allied to them, it can be shown that migration from the one region to the other has probably occurred at some former period, our general view will be much strengthened, for the explanation is obvious on the principle of descent with modification.

@sen3978   With organic beings which never intercross, if such exist, each species, must be descended from a succession of modified varieties, that have supplanted each other, but have never blended with other individuals or varieties of the same species, so that, at each successive stage of modification, all the individuals of the same form will be descended from a single parent.

@sen3979   But in the great majority of cases, namely, with all organisms which habitually unite for each birth, or which occasionally intercross, the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same area will be kept nearly uniform by intercrossing, so that many individuals will go on simultaneously changing, and the whole amount of modification at each stage will not be due to descent from a single parent.

@sen4104   These views, grounded as they are on the perfectly well-ascertained occurrence of a former Glacial period, seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a manner the present distribution of the Alpine and Arctic productions of Europe and America, that when in other regions we find the same species on distant mountain-summits, we may almost conclude, without other evidence, that a colder climate formerly permitted their migration across the intervening lowlands, now become too warm for their existence.

@sen4105   As the arctic forms moved first southward and afterwards backward to the north, in unison with the changing climate, they will not have been exposed during their long migrations to any great diversity of temperature, and as they all migrated in a body together, their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed.

@sen4107   But with the Alpine productions, left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth, first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains, the case will have been somewhat different, for it is not likely that all the same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges far distant from each other, and have survived there ever since, they will also, in all probability, have become mingled with ancient Alpine species, which must have existed on the mountains before the commencement of the Glacial epoch, and which during the coldest period will have been temporarily driven down to the plains, they will, also, have been subsequently exposed to somewhat different climatical influences.

@sen4112   During the Glacial period, when the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds lived further southwards than they do at present, they must have been still more completely separated from each other by wider spaces of ocean, so that it may well be asked how the same species could then or previously have entered the two continents.

@sen4118   Believing, from reasons before alluded to, that our continents have long remained in nearly the same relative position, though subjected to great oscillations of level, I am strongly inclined to extend the above view, and to infer that during some earlier and still warmer period, such as the older Pliocene period, a large number of the same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolar land, and that these plants and animals, both in the Old and New Worlds, began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate became less warm, long before the commencement of the Glacial period.

@sen4121   We can further understand the singular fact remarked on by several observers that the productions of Europe and America during the later tertiary stages were more closely related to each other than they are at the present time, for during these warmer periods the northern parts of the Old and New Worlds will have been almost continuously united by land, serving as a bridge, since rendered impassable by cold, for the intermigration of their inhabitants.

@sen4632   The principle formerly alluded to under the term of ANALOGICAL VARIATION has probably in these cases often come into play, that is, the members of the same class, although only distantly allied, have inherited so much in common in their constitution, that they are apt to vary under similar exciting causes in a similar manner, and this would obviously aid in the acquirement through natural selection of parts or organs, strikingly like each other, independently of their direct inheritance from a common progenitor.

@sen4656   From facts of this nature, Mr Bates concludes that the Leptalis first varies, and when a variety happens to resemble in some degree any common butterfly inhabiting the same district, this variety, from its resemblance to a flourishing and little persecuted kind, has a better chance of escaping destruction from predaceous birds and insects, and is consequently oftener preserved, "the less perfect degrees of resemblance being generation after generation eliminated, and only the others left to propagate their kind., So that here we have an excellent illustration of natural selection.

@sen4660   The much greater frequency of imitation with insects than with other animals, is probably the consequence of their small size, insects cannot defend themselves, excepting indeed the kinds furnished with a sting, and I have never heard of an instance of such kinds mocking other insects, though they are mocked, insects cannot easily escape by flight from the larger animals which prey on them, therefore, speaking metaphorically, they are reduced, like most weak creatures, to trickery and dissimulation.

@sen4730   Nevertheless, it is conceivable that the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as to be finally lost, by the reduction and ultimately by the complete abortion of certain parts, by the fusion of other parts, and by the doubling or multiplication of others, variations which we know to be within the limits of possibility.

@sen4737   In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another, and we can actually see, during the early or embryonic stages of development in flowers, as well as in crustaceans and many other animals, that organs, which when mature become extremely different are at first exactly alike.

@sen4745   We need not here consider how the bodies of some animals first became divided into a series of segments, or how they became divided into right and left sides, with corresponding organs, for such questions are almost beyond investigation.

@sen4747   It must suffice for our purpose to bear in mind that an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the common characteristic, as Owen has remarked, of all low or little specialised forms, therefore the unknown progenitor of the Vertebrata probably possessed many vertebrae, the unknown progenitor of the Articulata, many segments, and the unknown progenitor of flowering plants, many leaves arranged in one or more spires.

@sen4749   Consequently such parts, being already present in considerable numbers, and being highly variable, would naturally afford the materials for adaptation to the most different purposes, yet they would generally retain, through the force of inheritance, plain traces of their original or fundamental resemblance.

@sen4750   They would retain this resemblance all the more, as the variations, which afforded the basis for their subsequent modification through natural selection, would tend from the first to be similar, the parts being at an early stage of growth alike, and being subjected to nearly the same conditions.

@sen4772   It is, for instance, an astonishing fact that a delicate branching coralline, studded with polypi, and attached to a submarine rock, should produce, first by budding and then by transverse division, a host of huge floating jelly-fishes, and that these should produce eggs, from which are hatched swimming animalcules, which attach themselves to rocks and become developed into branching corallines, and so on in an endless cycle.

@sen4773   The belief in the essential identity of the process of alternate generation and of ordinary metamorphosis has been greatly strengthened by Wagner's discovery of the larva or maggot of a fly, namely the Cecidomyia, producing asexually other larvae, and these others, which finally are developed into mature males and females, propagating their kind in the ordinary manner by eggs.

@sen4810   But in some genera the larvae become developed into hermaphrodites having the ordinary structure, or into what I have called complemental males, and in the latter the development has assuredly been retrograde, for the male is a mere sack, which lives for a short time and is destitute of mouth, stomach, and every other organ of importance, excepting those for reproduction.

@sen4813   In some whole groups of animals and in certain members of other groups this is the case, and the embryo does not at any period differ widely from the adult, thus Owen has remarked in regard to cuttle-fish, "there is no metamorphosis, the cephalopodic character is manifested long before the parts of the embryo are completed., Land-shells and fresh-water crustaceans are born having their proper forms, while the marine members of the same two great classes pass through considerable and often great changes during their development.

@sen4818   How, then, can we explain these several facts in embryology--namely, the very general, though not universal, difference in structure between the embryo and the adult, the various parts in the same individual embryo, which ultimately become very unlike, and serve for diverse purposes, being at an early period of growth alike, the common, but not invariable, resemblance between the embryos or larvae of the most distinct species in the same class, the embryo often retaining, while within the egg or womb, structures which are of no service to it, either at that or at a later period of life, on the other hand, larvae which have to provide for their own wants, being perfectly adapted to the surrounding conditions, and lastly, the fact of certain larvae standing higher in the scale of organisation than the mature animal into which they are developed?

@sen4831   These two principles, namely, that slight variations generally appear at a not very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding not early period, explain, as I believe, all the above specified leading facts in embryology.

@sen4832   But first let us look to a few analogous cases in our domestic varieties.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4833   Some authors who have written on Dogs maintain that the greyhound and bull-dog, though so different, are really closely allied varieties, descended from the same wild stock, hence I was curious to see how far their puppies differed from each other.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4834   I was told by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents, and this, judging by the eye, seemed almost to be the case, but on actually measuring the old dogs and their six-days-old puppies, I found that the puppies had not acquired nearly their full amount of proportional difference.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4837   I carefully measured the proportions, [but will not here give the details], of the beak, width of mouth, length of nostril and of eyelid, size of feet and length of leg, in the wild parent species, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs, dragons, carriers, and tumblers.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4838   Now, some of these birds, when mature, differ in so extraordinary a manner in the length and form of beak, and in other characters, that they would certainly have been ranked as distinct genera if found in a state of nature.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4841   But there was one remarkable exception to this rule, for the young of the short-faced tumbler differed from the young of the wild rock-pigeon, and of the other breeds, in almost exactly the same proportions as in the adult stage.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4845   And the cases just given, more especially that of the pigeons, show that the characteristic differences which have been accumulated by man's selection, and which give value to his breeds, do not generally appear at a very early period of life, and are inherited at a corresponding not early period.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4846   But the case of the short-faced tumbler, which when twelve hours old possessed its proper characters, proves that this is not the universal rule, for here the characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual, if not so, the differences must have been inherited, not at a corresponding, but at an earlier age.

@sen4849   Then, from the many slight successive variations having supervened in the several species at a not early age, and having been inherited at a corresponding age, the young will have been but little modified, and they will still resemble each other much more closely than do the adults, just as we have seen with the breeds of the pigeon.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4851   The fore-limbs, for instance, which once served as legs to a remote progenitor, may have become, through a long course of modification, adapted in one descendant to act as hands, in another as paddles, in another as wings, but on the above two principles the fore-limbs will not have been much modified in the embryos of these several forms, although in each form the fore-limb will differ greatly in the adult state.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4852   Whatever influence long continued use or disuse may have had in modifying the limbs or other parts of any species, this will chiefly or solely have affected it when nearly mature, when it was compelled to use its full powers to gain its own living, and the effects thus produced will have been transmitted to the offspring at a corresponding nearly mature age.

@sen4856   And this is the rule of development in certain whole groups, or in certain sub-groups alone, as with cuttle-fish, land-shells, fresh-water crustaceans, spiders, and some members of the great class of insects.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4857   With respect to the final cause of the young in such groups not passing through any metamorphosis, we can see that this would follow from the following contingencies, namely, from the young having to provide at a very early age for their own wants, and from their following the same habits of life with their parents, for in this case it would be indispensable for their existence that they should be modified in the same manner as their parents.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4858   Again, with respect to the singular fact that many terrestrial and fresh-water animals do not undergo any metamorphosis, while marine members of the same groups pass through various transformations, Fritz Muller has suggested that the process of slowly modifying and adapting an animal to live on the land or in fresh water, instead of in the sea, would be greatly simplified by its not passing through any larval stage, for it is not probable that places well adapted for both the larval and mature stages, under such new and greatly changed habits of life, would commonly be found unoccupied or ill-occupied by other organisms.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4859   In this case the gradual acquirement at an earlier and earlier age of the adult structure would be favoured by natural selection, and all traces of former metamorphoses would finally be lost.
              " (quote is found in) part 107 of Darwin.dat

@sen4860   on the other hand, it profited the young of an animal to follow habits of life slightly different from those of the parent-form, and consequently to be constructed on a slightly different plan, or if it profited a larva already different from its parent to change still further, then, on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages, the young or the larvae might be rendered by natural selection more and more different from their parents to any conceivable extent.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4861   Differences in the larva might, also, become correlated with successive stages of its development, so that the larva, in the first stage, might come to differ greatly from the larva in the second stage, as is the case with many animals.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4862   The adult might also become fitted for sites or habits, in which organs of locomotion or of the senses, etc., would be useless, and in this case the metamorphosis would be retrograde.

@sen4863   From the remarks just made we can see how by changes of structure in the young, in conformity with changed habits of life, together with inheritance at corresponding ages, animals might come to pass through stages of development, perfectly distinct from the primordial condition of their adult progenitors.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4868   These larvae are hatched in the nests of bees, and when the male bees emerge from their burrows, in the spring, which they do before the females, the larvae spring on them, and afterwards crawl on to the females while paired with the males.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4870   Afterwards they undergo a complete change, their eyes disappear, their legs and antennae become rudimentary, and they feed on honey, so that they now more closely resemble the ordinary larvae of insects, ultimately they undergo a further transformation, and finally emerge as the perfect beetle.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4871   Now, if an insect, undergoing transformations like those of the Sitaris, were to become the progenitor of a whole new class of insects, the course of development of the new class would be widely different from that of our existing insects, and the first larval stage certainly would not represent the former condition of any adult and ancient form.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4872   On the other hand it is highly probable that with many animals the embryonic or larval stages show us, more or less completely, the condition of the progenitor of the whole group in its adult state.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4873   In the great class of the Crustacea, forms wonderfully distinct from each other, namely, suctorial parasites, cirripedes, entomostraca, and even the malacostraca, appear at first as larvae under the nauplius-form, and as these larvae live and feed in the open sea, and are not adapted for any peculiar habits of life, and from other reasons assigned by Fritz Muller, it is probable that at some very remote period an independent adult animal, resembling the Nauplius, existed, and subsequently produced, along several divergent lines of descent, the above-named great Crustacean groups.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4874   So again, it is probable, from what we know of the embryos of mammals, birds, fishes and reptiles, that these animals are the modified descendants of some ancient progenitor, which was furnished in its adult state with branchiae, a swim-bladder, four fin-like limbs, and a long tail, all fitted for an aquatic life.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4875   As all the organic beings, extinct and recent, which have ever lived, can be arranged within a few great classes, and as all within each class have, according to our theory, been connected together by fine gradations, the best, and, if our collections were nearly perfect, the only possible arrangement, would be genealogical, descent being the hidden bond of connexion which naturalists have been seeking under the term of the Natural System.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4876   On this view we can understand how it is that, in the eyes of most naturalists, the structure of the embryo is even more important for classification than that of the adult.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4877   In two or more groups of animals, however much they may differ from each other in structure and habits in their adult condition, if they pass through closely similar embryonic stages, we may feel assured that they are all descended from one parent-form, and are therefore closely related.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4878   Thus, community in embryonic structure reveals community of descent, but dissimilarity in embryonic development does not prove discommunity of descent, for in one of two groups the developmental stages may have been suppressed, or may have been so greatly modified through adaptation to new habits of life as to be no longer recognisable.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4879   Even in groups, in which the adults have been modified to an extreme degree, community of origin is often revealed by the structure of the larvae, we have seen, for instance, that cirripedes, though externally so like shell-fish, are at once known by their larvae to belong to the great class of crustaceans.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4880   As the embryo often shows us more or less plainly the structure of the less modified and ancient progenitor of the group, we can see why ancient and extinct forms so often resemble in their adult state the embryos of existing species of the same class.

@sen4882   It can, however, be proved true only in those cases in which the ancient state of the progenitor of the group has not been wholly obliterated, either by successive variations having supervened at a very early period of growth, or by such variations having been inherited at an earlier age than that at which they first appeared.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4883   It should also be borne in mind, that the law may be true, but yet, owing to the geological record not extending far enough back in time, may remain for a long period, or for ever, incapable of demonstration.
              " (quote is found in) part 108 of Darwin.dat

@sen4884   The law will not strictly hold good in those cases in which an ancient form became adapted in its larval state to some special line of life, and transmitted the same larval state to a whole group of descendants, for such larval state will not resemble any still more ancient form in its adult state.

@sen4885   Thus, as it seems to me, the leading facts in embryology, which are second to none in importance, are explained on the principle of variations in the many descendants from some one ancient progenitor, having appeared at a not very early period of life, and having been inherited at a corresponding period.

@sen4939   We often see rudiments of various parts in monsters, but I doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs in a state of nature, further than by showing that rudiments can be produced, for the balance of evidence clearly indicates that species under nature do not undergo great and abrupt changes.

@sen4942   It would at first lead by slow steps to the more and more complete reduction of a part, until at last it became rudimentary--as in the case of the eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns, and of the wings of birds inhabiting oceanic islands, which have seldom been forced by beasts of prey to take flight, and have ultimately lost the power of flying.

@sen4943   Again, an organ, useful under certain conditions, might become injurious under others, as with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands, and in this case natural selection will have aided in reducing the organ, until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary.

@sen4948   Moreover, at whatever period of life either disuse or selection reduces an organ, and this will generally be when the being has come to maturity and to exert its full powers of action, the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages will tend to reproduce the organ in its reduced state at the same mature age, but will seldom affect it in the embryo.

@sen4950   for instance, the digit of an adult animal was used less and less during many generations, owing to some change of habits, or if an organ or gland was less and less functionally exercised, we may infer that it would become reduced in size in the adult descendants of this animal, but would retain nearly its original standard of development in the embryo.

@sen4952   After an organ has ceased being used, and has become in consequence much reduced, how can it be still further reduced in size until the merest vestige is left, and how can it be finally quite obliterated?

@sen4955   for instance, it could be proved that every part of the organisation tends to vary in a greater degree towards diminution than toward augmentation of size, then we should be able to understand how an organ which has become useless would be rendered, independently of the effects of disuse, rudimentary and would at last be wholly suppressed, for the variations towards diminished size would no longer be checked by natural selection.

@sen4956   The principle of the economy of growth, explained in a former chapter, by which the materials forming any part, if not useful to the possessor, are saved as far as is possible, will perhaps come into play in rendering a useless part rudimentary.

@sen4957   But this principle will almost necessarily be confined to the earlier stages of the process of reduction, for we cannot suppose that a minute papilla, for instance, representing in a male flower the pistil of the female flower, and formed merely of cellular tissue, could be further reduced or absorbed for the sake of economising nutriment.

@sen4958   Finally, as rudimentary organs, by whatever steps they may have been degraded into their present useless condition, are the record of a former state of things, and have been retained solely through the power of inheritance--we can understand, on the genealogical view of classification, how it is that systematists, in placing organisms in their proper places in the natural system, have often found rudimentary parts as useful as, or even sometimes more useful than, parts of high physiological importance.

@sen4984   There are, it must be admitted, cases of special difficulty opposed to the theory of natural selection, and one of the most curious of these is the existence in the same community of two or three defined castes of workers or sterile female ants, but I have attempted to show how these difficulties can be mastered.

@sen4985   With respect to the almost universal sterility of species when first crossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal fertility of varieties when crossed, I must refer the reader to the recapitulation of the facts given at the end of the ninth chapter, which seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a special endowment than is the incapacity of two distinct kinds of trees to be grafted together, but that it is incidental on differences confined to the reproductive systems of the intercrossed species.
              " (quote is found in) part 110 of Darwin.dat

@sen4986   We see the truth of this conclusion in the vast difference in the results of crossing the same two species reciprocally--that is, when one species is first used as the father and then as the mother.
              " (quote is found in) part 110 of Darwin.dat

@sen4987   Analogy from the consideration of dimorphic and trimorphic plants clearly leads to the same conclusion, for when the forms are illegitimately united, they yield few or no seed, and their offspring are more or less sterile, and these forms belong to the same undoubted species, and differ from each other in no respect except in their reproductive organs and functions.
              " (quote is found in) part 110 of Darwin.dat

@sen4988   Although the fertility of varieties when intercrossed, and of their mongrel offspring, has been asserted by so many authors to be universal, this cannot be considered as quite correct after the facts given on the high authority of Gartner and Kolreuter.
              " (quote is found in) part 110 of Darwin.dat

@sen4989   Most of the varieties which have been experimented on have been produced under domestication, and as domestication, [I do not mean mere confinement], almost certainly tends to eliminate that sterility which, judging from analogy, would have affected the parent-species if intercrossed, we ought not to expect that domestication would likewise induce sterility in their modified descendants when crossed.
              " (quote is found in) part 110 of Darwin.dat

@sen4990   This elimination of sterility apparently follows from the same cause which allows our domestic animals to breed freely under diversified circumstances, and this again apparently follows from their having been gradually accustomed to frequent changes in their conditions of life.

@sen4991   A double and parallel series of facts seems to throw much light on the sterility of species, when first crossed, and of their hybrid offspring.

@sen4992   On the one side, there is good reason to believe that slight changes in the conditions of life give vigour and fertility to all organic beings.

@sen4993   We know also that a cross between the distinct individuals of the same variety, and between distinct varieties, increases the number of their offspring, and certainly gives to them increased size and vigour.
              " (quote is found in) part 110 of Darwin.dat

@sen4994   This is chiefly owing to the forms which are crossed having been exposed to somewhat different conditions of life, for I have ascertained by a labourious series of experiments that if all the individuals of the same variety be subjected during several generations to the same conditions, the good derived from crossing is often much diminished or wholly disappears.
              " (quote is found in) part 110 of Darwin.dat

@sen4996   On the other side, we know that species which have long been exposed to nearly uniform conditions, when they are subjected under confinement to new and greatly changed conditions, either perish, or if they survive, are rendered sterile, though retaining perfect health.

@sen4998   Hence when we find that hybrids produced by a cross between two distinct species are few in number, owing to their perishing soon after conception or at a very early age, or if surviving that they are rendered more or less sterile, it seems highly probable that this result is due to their having been in fact subjected to a great change in their conditions of life, from being compounded of two distinct organisations.

@sen5085   On the view that species are only strongly marked and permanent varieties, and that each species first existed as a variety, we can see why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species, commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation, and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondary laws.

@sen5086   On this same view we can understand how it is that in a region where many species of a genus have been produced, and where they now flourish, these same species should present many varieties, for where the manufactory of species has been active, we might expect, as a general rule, to find it still in action, and this is the case if varieties be incipient species.
              " (quote is found in) part 113 of Darwin.dat

@sen5087   Moreover, the species of the larger genera, which afford the greater number of varieties or incipient species, retain to a certain degree the character of varieties, for they differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do the species of smaller genera.

@sen5090   As each species tends by its geometrical rate of reproduction to increase inordinately in number, and as the modified descendants of each species will be enabled to increase by as much as they become more diversified in habits and structure, so as to be able to seize on many and widely different places in the economy of nature, there will be a constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the most divergent offspring of any one species.

@sen5212   It has been maintained by several authors that it is as easy to believe in the creation of a million beings as of one, but Maupertuis' philosophical axiom "of least action, leads the mind more willingly to admit the smaller number, and certainly we ought not to believe that innumerable beings within each great class have been created with plain, but deceptive, marks of descent from a single parent.

@sen5213   As a record of a former state of things, I have retained in the foregoing paragraphs, and elsewhere, several sentences which imply that naturalists believe in the separate creation of each species, and I have been much censured for having thus expressed myself.

@sen5218   There are, however, some who still think that species have suddenly given birth, through quite unexplained means, to new and totally different forms.

@sen5220   Under a scientific point of view, and as leading to further investigation, but little advantage is gained by believing that new forms are suddenly developed in an inexplicable manner from old and widely different forms, over the old belief in the creation of species from the dust of the earth.

@sen5226   Organs in a rudimentary condition plainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in a fully developed condition, and this in some cases implies an enormous amount of modification in the descendants.

@sen5237   As Professor Asa Gray has remarked, "the spores and other reproductive bodies of many of the lower algae may claim to have first a characteristically animal, and then an unequivocally vegetable existence., Therefore, on the principle of natural selection with divergence of character, it does not seem incredible that, from some such low and intermediate form, both animals and plants may have been developed, and, if we admit this, we must likewise admit that all the organic beings which have ever lived on this earth may be descended from some one primordial form.

@sen5241   For, as I have recently remarked in regard to the members of each great kingdom, such as the Vertebrata, Articulata, etc., we have distinct evidence in their embryological, homologous, and rudimentary structures, that within each kingdom all the members are descended from a single progenitor.

@sen5242   When the views advanced by me in this volume, and by Mr Wallace or when analogous views on the origin of species are generally admitted, we can dimly foresee that there will be a considerable revolution in natural history.

@sen5246   Systematists will have only to decide, [not that this will be easy], whether any form be sufficiently constant and distinct from other forms, to be capable of definition, and if definable, whether the differences be sufficiently important to deserve a specific name.
              " (quote is found in) part 116 of Darwin.dat

@sen5247   This latter point will become a far more essential consideration than it is at present, for differences, however slight, between any two forms, if not blended by intermediate gradations, are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raise both forms to the rank of species.
              " (quote is found in) part 116 of Darwin.dat

@sen5248   Hereafter we shall be compelled to acknowledge that the only distinction between species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are known, or believed to be connected at the present day by intermediate gradations, whereas species were formerly thus connected.

@sen5249   Hence, without rejecting the consideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations between any two forms, we shall be led to weigh more carefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between them.

@sen5255   When we no longer look at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship, as something wholly beyond his comprehension, when we regard every production of nature as one which has had a long history, when we contemplate every complex structure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances, each useful to the possessor, in the same way as any great mechanical invention is the summing up of the labour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous workmen, when we thus view each organic being, how far more interesting--I speak from experience--does the study of natural history become!

@sen5272   As species are produced and exterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes, and not by miraculous acts of creation, and as the most important of all causes of organic change is one which is almost independent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions, namely, the mutual relation of organism to organism--the improvement of one organism entailing the improvement or the extermination of others, it follows, that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutive formations probably serves as a fair measure of the relative, though not actual lapse of time.

@sen5273   A number of species, however, keeping in a body might remain for a long period unchanged, whilst within the same period, several of these species, by migrating into new countries and coming into competition with foreign associates, might become modified, so that we must not overrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of time.

@sen5281   And of the species now living very few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity, for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped, shows that the greater number of species in each genus, and all the species in many genera, have left no descendants, but have become utterly extinct.
