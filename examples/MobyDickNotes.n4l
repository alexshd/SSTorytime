@sen77   Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about, however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right, that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way, either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is, and so the universal thump is passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades, and be content.

@sen87   For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern, [that is, if you never violate the Pythagorean maxim], so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle.

@sen96   Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces, though I cannot tell why this was exactly, yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.
              " (quote is found in) part 2 of MobyDick.dat

@sen97   Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself.

@sen103   By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome, the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.

@sen111   As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing.

@sen1220   I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages, but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship’s company.

@sen1221   I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very large, but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay, that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually amount to.

@sen2456   Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
              " (quote is found in) part 54 of MobyDick.dat

@sen2457   The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an officer called the Specksnyder.
              " (quote is found in) part 54 of MobyDick.dat

@sen2458   Literally this word means Fat-Cutter, usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer.
              " (quote is found in) part 54 of MobyDick.dat

@sen2459   In those days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel, while over the whale-hunting department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer reigned supreme.

              " (quote is found in) part 54 of MobyDick.dat

@sen2462   Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat, but under certain circumstances, [night watches on a whaling ground], the command of the ship’s deck is also his, therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior, though always, by them, familiarly regarded as their social equal.
              " (quote is found in) part 54 of MobyDick.dat

@sen2464   Hence, in whale-ships and merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain, and so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship.

@sen2601   When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him, [also fixed in the rack], together with a powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters, for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing.

@sen2602   Now, it was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest, but though he so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the “local attraction, of all binnacle magnets, an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew, I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned “binnacle deviations, “azimuth compass observations, and “approximate errors, he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, within easy reach of his hand.

@sen2603   Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain, yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the pole.

@sen3437   But not so did it seem to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents, and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whale’s food, and, also, calling to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes, could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey.

@sen3438   So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world, were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the flights of swallows.

@sen3440   *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by   an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National   Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851.

@sen3442   “This chart divides the   ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of   longitude, perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve   columns for the twelve months, and horizontally through each of which   districts are three lines, one to show the number of days that have   been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to   show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been   seen.”

@sen3444   Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct, say, rather, secret intelligence from the Deity, mostly swim in _veins_, as they are called, continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one tithe of such marvellous precision.
              " (quote is found in) part 76 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3445   Though, in these cases, the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel, and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width, [more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract], but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship’s mast-heads, when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone.

@sen3450   Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season, though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true.

@sen3487   I care not to perform this part of my task methodically, but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman, and from these citations, I take it, the conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself.
              " (quote is found in) part 77 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3488   First, I have personally known three instances where a whale, after receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape, and, after an interval, [in one instance of three years], has been again struck by the same hand, and slain, when the two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body.
              " (quote is found in) part 77 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3489   In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons, and I think it may have been something more than that, the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions.

@sen3490   Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels, no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa, but to no purpose.

@sen3493   In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous.

@sen3496   Secondly, It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable.
              " (quote is found in) part 77 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3497   Why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales, for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil.
              " (quote is found in) part 77 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3498   the reason was this, that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea, without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance.

@sen3575   I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale.

@sen3576   In more than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks.

@sen3577   The English ship Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head, and, as for his strength, let me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured there, the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks off with a cart.
              " (quote is found in) part 79 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3578   Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers, nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes.

@sen3579   But I must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration, a remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels, [like all marvels], are mere repetitions of the ages, so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon, Verily there is nothing new under the sun.

@sen3583   Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years.

@sen3588   And I will tell you why.
              " (quote is found in) part 79 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3589   For a long time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it.

@sen3591   But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean.
              " (quote is found in) part 79 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3592   I am told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale.
              " (quote is found in) part 79 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3593   Now, as a vessel of war readily passes through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route, pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
              " (quote is found in) part 79 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3594   In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar substance called _brit_ is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.
              " (quote is found in) part 79 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3595   But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whale, squid or cuttle-fish, lurks at the bottom of that sea, because large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been found at its surface.
              " (quote is found in) part 79 of MobyDick.dat

@sen3596   then, you properly put these statements together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that, according to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all probability have been a sperm whale.

@sen3600   Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby Dick, though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion, nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage.

@sen3609   Not only that, but the subtle insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it, that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background, [for few men’s courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action], that when they stood their long night watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than Moby Dick.

@sen3620   Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the Pequod’s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation, and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command.

@sen4591   The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary ropes, for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use, yet, not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which it must be subjected, but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in general by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however much it may give it compactness and gloss.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4592   Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines, for, though not so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic, and I will add, [since there is an æsthetics in all things], is much more handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4593   Hemp is a dusky, dark fellow, a sort of Indian, but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian to behold.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4594   The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4596   By experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds, so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4598   Towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely bedded “sheaves, or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any hollow but the “heart, or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4599   As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off, the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4600   Some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business, carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4601   In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one, the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4602   There is some advantage in this, because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat, and do not strain it so much, whereas, the American tub, nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in thickness, for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a concentrated one.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4603   When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4604   Both ends of the line are exposed, the lower end terminating in an eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4606   First, In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4607   In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other, though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4608   Second, This arrangement is indispensable for common safety’s sake, for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea, and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4609   Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing, and also passing between the men, as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4610   From the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the boat again, and some ten or twenty fathoms, [called box-line], being coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp, the rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon, but previous to that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4611   Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils, twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4612   All the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions, so that to the timid eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4613   Nor can any son of mortal woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies, and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings, he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4615   what cannot habit accomplish, Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes, and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus hung in hangman’s nooses, and, like the six burghers of Calais before King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4616   Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasters, some few of which are casually chronicled, of this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4617   For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and wheel, is grazing you.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4618   It is worse, for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle, and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest warning, and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could never pierce you out.
              " (quote is found in) part 102 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4619   Again, as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself, for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm, and contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder, and the ball, and the explosion, so the graceful repose of the line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual play, this is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair.

@sen4622   All are born with halters round their necks, but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death, that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.

@sen4623   And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.

@sen4630   For this part of the Indian Ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground, that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins, flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than those off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.

@sen4716   No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are successful, no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated, no wonder that some of them actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat, no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels, no wonder that to many ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern, for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted!

@sen4721   I know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase, but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them.

@sen4731   It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.
              " (quote is found in) part 105 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4732   But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with the line, the object being this, to dart them both, if possible, one instantly after the other into the same whale, so that if, in the coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold.
              " (quote is found in) part 105 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4734   But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into him.
              " (quote is found in) part 105 of MobyDick.dat

@sen4735   Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere, else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands.

@sen4740   Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale, when owing to these qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him.

@sen4752   Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had evinced his customary activity, to call it so, yet now that the creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or despair, seemed working in him, as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain, and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot advance his grand, monomaniac object.

@sen4755   Tied by the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through the darkness of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two, ship and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one reclines while the other remains standing.*

@sen4757   The strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside, is by the flukes or tail, and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other, [excepting the side-fins], its flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface, so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to put the chain round it.

@sen4759   By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily made to follow suit, and being slipped along the body, is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes.

@sen6554   I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds, might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the Frenchman’s two whales.

              " (quote is found in) part 145 of MobyDick.dat

@sen6559   I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago.
              " (quote is found in) part 145 of MobyDick.dat

@sen6560   Because those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as the Southern ships have always done, but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it home in that manner, the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any other course.
              " (quote is found in) part 145 of MobyDick.dat

@sen6561   The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital.
              " (quote is found in) part 145 of MobyDick.dat

@sen6562   I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great work on Smells, a text-book on that subject.
              " (quote is found in) part 145 of MobyDick.dat

@sen6563   As its name imports, [smeer, fat; berg, to put up], this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose.

@sen6565   But all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler, which in a voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out, and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.

@sen6852   When he halted before the binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose, and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.
              " (quote is found in) part 152 of MobyDick.dat

@sen6853   But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them.
              " (quote is found in) part 152 of MobyDick.dat

@sen6854   And some certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass in the Milky Way.
              " (quote is found in) part 152 of MobyDick.dat

@sen6855   Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands, the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows.
              " (quote is found in) part 152 of MobyDick.dat

@sen6857   Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last.

@sen7266   According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length, according to my careful calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons, so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants.

@sen7270   In length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two feet, so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have been ninety feet long, for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body.

@sen8754   Ahab must have the doubloon, and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines, and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the downward-reeved rope, and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail.
              " (quote is found in) part 194 of MobyDick.dat

@sen8755   This done, with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other, pausing his glance long upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego, but shunning Fedallah, and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said, “Take the rope, sir, I give it into thy hands, Starbuck., Then arranging his person in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last, and afterwards stood near it.

@sen8757   When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope, under these circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it.
              " (quote is found in) part 194 of MobyDick.dat

@sen8758   Because in such a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck, and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea.

@sen8759   So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not unusual, the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision, one of those too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt somewhat, it was strange, that this was the very man he should select for his watchman, freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person’s hands.

@sen8760   Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft, ere he had been there ten minutes, one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these latitudes, one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings.
