#+title: How I Org

* A day in the life

Get up, stand up, grab my phone, stumble to the kitchen, make coffee, take medicine unlock phone check off meds from my Orgzly home screen widget.



So, yeah, I am probably interacting with org-mode within the first hour or so of the day.

Morning routine happens and get the kids to school. I might have captured a few notes using Orgzly during the news or while chatting with the family.

I get to my desk. Emacs is already full screen on my central screen probably open to yesterdays "work log" note[fn:1].

I run ~org-roam-goto-today~ and select my work log capture template (=wll= ... it's semantic, work, log, log)[fn:2]. I land at a new file for today it's setup with broiler plate stuff.

I run =org-roam-capture-today= and select the capture template for my first meeting of the day. =wm<Product>s= (work meeting <Product> sync/stand-up)[fn:3].

* Footnotes

[fn:1] Maybe I just walked away, if so it's open to a buffer asking me what I want to do with the idle time since I had an open clock session. Usually I just discard that idle time and clock out of the previous task I was on. ADHD is real, this a fairly common if not often occurrence.

[fn:2] Nick, why are you stuttering? Because it used to be just work log (=wl=) but then I added some capture templates for specific work log captures and I wanted to keep the generic template to as similar key binding as possible so that it was not difficult to adjust my muscle memory.

[fn:3] It's no secret, <Product> here is =c= for my beloved [[id:3ffe6747-77c1-412a-851f-115a3782fa65][CFEngine]].
