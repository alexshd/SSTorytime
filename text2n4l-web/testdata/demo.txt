# Test Document for N4L Conversion

This is a test document to demonstrate the N4L conversion functionality. It contains multiple sentences that should be analyzed for intentionality and coherence.

The first paragraph introduces the topic and establishes context. This is important for narrative flow and should be captured in the N4L output.

The second paragraph continues the narrative. It builds upon the previous content and adds new information. This creates a coherent story structure.

Some sentences may be marked as ambiguous. These are sentences where the intentionality scoring is uncertain or below the confidence threshold.

The final paragraph concludes the document. It provides closure and completes the narrative arc. This demonstrates how the analyzer handles ending sequences.

This is an example of longer content that would be processed in batches for better user experience.
