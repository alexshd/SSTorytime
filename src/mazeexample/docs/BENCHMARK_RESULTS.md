## Key Findings

### 🎉 Major Wins (Where Pointer-Based Shines)

1. **Path Finding (The Big One!)**

   - Depth1: **56% faster** - From 3964ns → 1752ns
   - Depth5: **22% faster** - From 17369ns → 13610ns
   - Memory: **43% less** at depth 5!
   - **This is THE critical operation** - bidirectional search performance is dramatically better

2. **Full Maze Solving**

   - **20% faster overall** - From 2.84ms → 2.28ms
   - **20% less memory** - From 499KB → 246KB
   - Real-world integration test shows combined benefits

3. **Graph Building**

   - **43% less memory!** - From 5832B → 3344B
   - Fewer maps = less allocation overhead

4. **Direct Access Operations**
   - Open: **56% faster** - No handle map initialization
   - Edge creation: **35% less memory**
   - Link lookup operations benefit from pointer dereferencing

### ⚠️ Trade-offs (Expected)

1. **More Allocations**

   - Pointers require heap allocation
   - Handle version used value types (stack-friendly)
   - Trade-off: more allocations BUT less total memory and faster lookups

2. **Small Operation Overhead**
   - Vertex creation slightly slower (need to allocate node)
   - Edge creation slightly slower (allocating link pointers)
   - AdjointLinkPath slower (creating new link pointers vs copying values)

### 🎯 Architecture Analysis

**Why Pointer-Based Wins:**

```go
// OLD: 3 map lookups to traverse
handle := graph.nameTohandle["a7"]    // Lookup 1
node := graph.handleToNode[handle]    // Lookup 2
links := graph.forward[handle]        // Lookup 3

// NEW: 1 map lookup + direct pointer access
node := graph.nodes["a7"]             // Lookup 1
links := node.forward                 // Direct! ← This is the win!
```

**The Pattern:**

- **Setup operations** (Vertex, Edge): Slightly slower (more allocations)
- **Traversal operations** (Paths, Search): **Much faster** (fewer lookups)
- **Real workloads** (SolveMaze): **Faster overall** (dominated by traversals)

## Conclusion

### ✅ Refactoring Success!

The pointer-based architecture achieves exactly what we predicted:

1. **Simpler Code**: Eliminated NodeHandle, ArrowHandle, 5 maps → 1 map + node fields
2. **Faster Where It Matters**: Path finding (core algorithm) is **22-56% faster**
3. **Less Memory**: **27-43% reduction** in memory for key operations
4. **More Idiomatic Go**: Using native pointers instead of emulating them

### When Each Excels

**Pointer-Based Wins** (traversal-heavy):

- Path finding and graph traversal 🏆
- Full maze solving 🏆
- Operations that follow many links
- Real-world usage patterns

**Handle-Based Wins** (construction-heavy):

- Micro-benchmarks of single operations
- Building small graphs from scratch
- Minimal allocation scenarios

### The Bottom Line

For **graph algorithms** (BFS, pathfinding, traversal), the pointer-based architecture is **clearly superior**:

- 20% faster end-to-end performance
- 43% less memory in path enumeration
- Simpler, more maintainable code
- Idiomatic Go design

The trade-off of more small allocations is **well worth** the gains in lookup performance and memory efficiency for the actual algorithms.
