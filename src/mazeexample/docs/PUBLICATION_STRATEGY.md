   - Need "killer app" to care

8. **Mainstream AI Researchers**
   - Different research priorities
   - Would need strong empirical results
   - Maze solving isn't compelling problem

---

## Key Success Factors

### ✅ **Do This** (High Impact)

1. **Frame as "Burgess Operationalized"**

   - Promise Theory has followers who will amplify
   - Direct connection to respected theorist

2. **Show Performance Benefits**

   - Your 20-56% improvements are compelling
   - Benchmark methodology is solid
   - Real-world relevance

3. **Provide Working Code**

   - GitHub repo is gold
   - Others can experiment
   - Reproducible results

4. **Create Great Visualizations**

   - Your viewer.html is excellent
   - Visual intuition helps understanding
   - Shareable/tweetable

5. **Write Accessible Blog Posts**
   - Start with "Why" not "What"
   - Use analogies (not just math)
   - Code snippets that compile

### ❌ **Avoid This** (Will Hurt)

1. **Overselling Novelty**

   - Don't claim to "revolutionize" BFS
   - Be precise about what's novel
   - Acknowledge related work honestly

2. **Pure Theory Without Applications**

   - Maze solving alone isn't enough
   - Need 2-3 more application domains
   - Show promise chain, causality, story generation

3. **Ignoring Graph DB Literature**

   - Must cite Neo4j, property graphs
   - Must compare to SPARQL, Cypher
   - Show you know the field

4. **Unclear Writing**
   - Don't assume readers know Promise Theory
   - Define terms explicitly
   - Provide intuitive explanations

## Bottom Line Recommendation

### **Start Small, Build Momentum**

#### Week 1-2: Community Engagement

```markdown
1. Write blog post: "I Implemented Promise Theory and Here's What I Learned"
2. Post on HN/Reddit with good title
3. Share in Go/graph communities

3. Give talks, gather feedback
```

#### Month 4-6: Academic Publication

```markdown
1. Write LISA paper (Burgess's community)
2. Or write graph algorithms workshop paper
3. Incorporate community feedback
```

### **Most Likely Outcome**

With effort:

- ✅ 1-2 conference talks (90% probability)
- ✅ Strong HN engagement (70% probability)
- ✅ Recognition in Promise Theory community (80% probability)
- ✅ Blog post with >10K views (60% probability)
- ⚠️ Top-tier conference acceptance (20% probability)

## Final Verdict

### **Yes, People Will Find This Interesting**

Your work sits at an interesting intersection:

- ✅ Novel enough to be publishable
- ✅ Practical enough to be useful
- ✅ Connected to respected theory (Burgess)
- ✅ Well-implemented (working code + benchmarks)

### **But Target the Right Audience**

Don't aim for:

- ❌ General software engineering audience (too abstract)
- ❌ Mainstream AI conferences (wrong problem domain)
- ❌ Pure theory venues (need more formal treatment)

**DO aim for:**

- ✅ Promise Theory / CFEngine community
- ✅ Graph database practitioners
- ✅ Systems/DevOps conferences
- ✅ Practitioner-oriented venues

### **Your Competitive Advantages**

1. **Working implementation** - Most theory papers don't have this
2. **Performance analysis** - Benchmarks are rigorous
3. **Clear problem** - Maze solving is understandable
4. **Conceptual novelty** - Semantic interpretation is fresh
5. **Burgess connection** - Built-in interested audience

## Action Items (This Week)

If you want to move forward:

1. **Write blog post** - "Promise Theory Operationalized: A Case Study"
2. **Create video** - 5-minute demo of maze solver + visualization
3. **Email Mark Burgess** - "I implemented your ideas, here's what I learned"
4. **Submit to FOSDEM** - Deadline is soon (Nov 2025)
5. **Polish GitHub README** - Make it publication-ready

**You have something real here. Don't let it sit on your laptop.** 🚀

The Promise Theory community alone (small but engaged) will find this genuinely interesting. Start there, build momentum, then expand to broader venues.
