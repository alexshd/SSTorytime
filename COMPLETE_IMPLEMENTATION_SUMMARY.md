- **String concatenation**: Fast in modern JS engines
- **Reflow/repaint**: Minimal, CodeMirror optimized
- **User can scroll**: Yes, during streaming

## Key Code Snippets

### Backend Streaming (Go)

```go
// Flush every 5 sentences
for idx, sel := range selection {
    w.WriteString(fmt.Sprintf("\n@sen%d   %s\n", sel.Order, Sanitize(sel.Fragment)))

    if (idx+1)%5 == 0 || idx == len(selection)-1 {
        w.Flush()       // Buffered writer
        flusher.Flush() // HTTP flusher
    }
}
```

### Frontend Streaming (JavaScript)

```javascript
// Read stream chunks
const reader = response.body.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
let accumulatedText = "";

while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;

  const chunk = decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
  accumulatedText += chunk;
  n4lEditor.setContent(accumulatedText);
}
```

### Cancel with Confirmation

```javascript
function cancelConversion(elements) {
  if (!state.abortController) return;

  if (confirm("Are you sure you want to cancel?")) {
    state.abortController.abort();
  }
}
```

**Coverage:** 98%+ of global browser usage

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Working Indicator

- None known

### Streaming

1. **No backend cancellation**: Server continues processing after client abort

   - Impact: Low (server resources cleaned up automatically)
   - Priority: Low
   - Workaround: None needed

2. **No progress percentage**: Can't show "45% complete"

   - Impact: Medium (would be nice to have)
   - Priority: Medium
   - Workaround: Show sentence count instead

3. **No resume from checkpoint**: Cancel requires full restart
   - Impact: Low (rare use case)
   - Priority: Low
   - Workaround: Don't cancel :)

---

## Future Enhancements

### Priority 1 (Easy Wins)

- [ ] Show sentence count during streaming: "Received 45 sentences..."
- [ ] ESC key to cancel (keyboard shortcut)
- [ ] Toast notifications instead of status bar
- [ ] Dark mode support for spinner/buttons

### Priority 2 (Medium Effort)

- [ ] Progress bar based on estimated time
- [ ] Auto-scroll to latest content (optional toggle)
- [ ] Partial result saving
- [ ] Retry on error

### Priority 3 (Major Features)

- [ ] WebSocket for bidirectional communication
- [ ] Server-Sent Events (SSE) alternative
- [ ] Resume from checkpoint
- [ ] Delta updates (send only new data)
- [ ] Parallel processing for very large files

---

## Rollback Strategy

If streaming causes issues:

### Quick Rollback (5 minutes)

```javascript
// In main-codemirror.js line ~179
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:8080/api/convert', {
  // Change back to original buffered endpoint
```

### Full Rollback (30 minutes)

1. Revert `main-codemirror.js` to previous version
2. Revert `app.html` to previous version (optional, indicator still useful)
3. Restart frontend server
4. Backend: Keep both endpoints, no need to rollback

**Risk:** Low - Buffered endpoint still exists and works

---

## Success Story

### Scenario: User Converting 100KB Document

**Before:**

```
0s:    Click Convert
       [Staring at empty screen]
5s:    "Is it working?"
10s:   "Should I refresh?"
15s:   "Maybe my internet is slow?"
30s:   Results finally appear
       "Finally! Took forever..."
```

**After:**

```
0s:    Click Convert
0.5s:  "Oh, it's already working!"
       [Sees header]
1s:    "Cool, sentences are appearing!"
       [Sees first results]
5s:    [Reading results while more stream in]
10s:   [Still reading, more appearing]
30s:   "Done! That felt fast!"
       [Complete]
```

**Result:** Same 30s processing, but user experience is **dramatically better**.

---

## Team Communication

### For Product Managers

"We've made file conversion feel 60x faster by showing results immediately instead of making users wait. Same processing time, but users see progress within half a second instead of waiting 30+ seconds for large files."

### For Developers

"Implemented HTTP chunked transfer encoding on backend with progressive flushing every 5 sentences. Frontend uses ReadableStream API to consume chunks and update CodeMirror incrementally. Added working indicator with spinner and cancel button. All changes backward compatible."

### For QA

"Test three scenarios: small (<1KB), medium (10-50KB), and large (100KB+) files. Verify header appears within 1 second, sentences stream progressively, cancel button works mid-stream, and final result is identical to buffered version. Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge."

### For Support

"Users will now see results appear immediately when converting files, instead of waiting for the entire conversion to complete. They can also cancel conversions in progress if needed. This makes the tool feel much more responsive, especially for large files."
