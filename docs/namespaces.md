# Namespace concept - draft thoughts

The need for namespaces in SSTorytime is still to be developed fully.

* Knowledge is personal, but it is designed for sharing. Access control may be applied to it, but the requirements for access control are as yet unclear.

* Each user's interaction with the system is individual, so progress tracking and configuration settings need to be personalized. To design this, we first need to know what data we want to keep. The data study thus takes priority.

* Learning benefits from exposure to alternative viewpoints (even opposites), so there is a need to relate different users' notes in some way. This is primariy a configuration issue.

* Different style schemes for different areas are also desirable, based on colours and fonts. 

Discriminating user spaces and login issues will not be considered in the first iteration of the technology as these are trivial but complicating. Rather, it's important to develop the primary issues that concern learning so that users can get to work as quickly as possible.
