# N4L Editor Logo & Branding

## Design Concept

The N4L Editor logo represents the core concept of semantic knowledge graphs with a fun, modern aesthetic.

### Visual Elements

1. **Knowledge Graph Nodes** (Green circles)

   - Represent concepts/entities in the knowledge graph
   - Green (#10b981) symbolizes growth, learning, and connections
   - Three nodes form a simple but meaningful network

2. **Semantic Arrows** (Golden yellow)

   - Directional arrows show relationships between concepts
   - Gradient from #fbbf24 to #f59e0b adds depth
   - Represents the N4L semantic relationship types (NR-0, LT-1, CN-2, EP-3)

3. **Background** (Blue-Purple gradient)

   - Professional yet friendly gradient (#3b82f6 to #8b5cf6)
   - Represents technology and creativity
   - High contrast makes the logo pop

4. **Typography**

   - Bold "N4L" text for clear branding
   - Clean, modern sans-serif font
   - White color for maximum visibility

5. **Sparkles** (Small golden dots)
   - Add playfulness and energy
   - Suggest the "aha!" moments of knowledge discovery
   - Subtle animation in the animated version
