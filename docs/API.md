# An API for interacting with the SST graph

You will find many examples of using Go(lang) code to write custom scripts
that interact with the database through the Go API
[here](https://github.com/markburgess/SSTorytime/tree/main/src/demo_pocs).

Notable examples:
* [Maze solver 1](../src/demo_pocs/search_maze.go) and * [Maze solver 2](demo_pocs/search_maze2.go)
* [Path solver](../src/pathsolve.go)
* [Graph reporter](../src/graph_report.go)

## Creating an SST graph from data

See the [example](../src/API_EXAMPLE.go). To make node registration as easy as possible, you can use two functions
`Vertex()` and `Edge()` to create nodes and links respectively. These names are chosen to distance themselves
from the underlying `Node` and `Link`naming, by using the more mathematical names for these objects.

### Structure

Assuming the arrow names have been defined (e.g. by uploading them using N4L),
then to open the context channel for the database, we bracket the meat of a program with
Open and Close functions:

<pre>
func main() {

	load_arrows := false
	ctx := SST.Open(load_arrows)

	AddStory(ctx)
	LookupStory(ctx)

	SST.Close(ctx)
}

</pre>

### Add nodes and links from data

For the meat of an AddStory function, we can use the Vertex and Edge functions to avoid low level details.
Adding nodes to a database, without using the N4L language is straightforward:
<pre>
	chap := "home and away"
	context := []string{""}
	var w float32 = 1.0

	n1 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"Mary had a little lamb",chap)
	n2 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"Whose fleece was dull and grey",chap)

	n3 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"And every time she washed it clean",chap)
	n4 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"It just went to roll in the hay",chap)

	n5 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"And when it reached a certain age ",chap)
	n6 := SST.Vertex(ctx,"She'd serve it on a tray",chap)

	SST.Edge(ctx,n1,"then",n2,context,w)

	// bifurcation!

	SST.Edge(ctx,n2,"then",n3,context,w/2)
	SST.Edge(ctx,n2,"then",n5,context,w/2)

	// endings

	SST.Edge(ctx,n3,"then",n4,context,w)
	SST.Edge(ctx,n5,"then",n6,context,w)

</pre>

### Reading the graph back

Looking up up the data is more complicated because there are many options.
This example looks for story paths starting from a node that we search for by name.
<ol>
<li>First we get a pointer to the starting node by random access lookup:
<pre>
	start_set := SST.GetDBNodePtrMatchingName(ctx,"Mary had a","")
</pre>
Because there might be several nodes that match your name description, this returns
an array of pointers.

<li>Next we want to know the Semantic Spacetime type of link to follow.
If you remember the numbers -3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 of the link type (leadsto,contains,property,near)
you can select `sttype` directly. If you only remember the name of the relation, you can search
for it:
<pre>
	_,sttype := SST.GetDBArrowsWithArrowName(ctx,"then")
</pre>
<li>Setting a limit on the path length to explore, you search for the forward cone
of type `sttype` from the starting set of node pointers.
<pre>
	path_length := 4

	for n := range start_set {

		paths,_ := SST.GetFwdPathsAsLinks(ctx,start_set[n],sttype,path_length)

		for p := range paths {

			if len(paths[p]) > 1 {
			
				fmt.Println("    Path",p," len",len(paths[p]))

				for l := 0; l < len(paths[p]); l++ {

					// Find the long node name details from the pointer

					name := SST.GetDBNodeByNodePtr(ctx,paths[p][l].Dst).S

					fmt.Println("    ",l,"xx  --> ",
						paths[p][l].Dst,"=",name,"  , weight",
						paths[p][l].Wgt,"context",paths[p][l].Ctx)
				}
			}
		}
	}

</pre>
</ol>

### Checking the result

Running the `API_EXAMPLE.go` program:
<pre>
$ cd src
$ make
go build -o API_EXAMPLE API_EXAMPLE.go
$ ./API_EXAMPLE 
    Path 0  len 4
     0 xx  -->  {4 0} = Mary had a little lamb   , weight 1 context []
     1 xx  -->  {4 2} = Whose fleece was white as snow   , weight 1 context [cutting edge high brow poem]
     2 xx  -->  {4 3} = And everywhere that Mary went   , weight 1 context [cutting edge high brow poem]
     3 xx  -->  {4 4} = The lamb was sure to go   , weight 1 context [cutting edge high brow poem]
    Path 1  len 4
     0 xx  -->  {4 0} = Mary had a little lamb   , weight 1 context []
     1 xx  -->  {4 987} = Whose fleece was dull and grey   , weight 1 context []
     2 xx  -->  {4 988} = And every time she washed it clean   , weight 0.5 context []
     3 xx  -->  {4 989} = It just went to roll in the hay   , weight 1 context []
    Path 2  len 4
     0 xx  -->  {4 0} = Mary had a little lamb   , weight 1 context []
     1 xx  -->  {4 987} = Whose fleece was dull and grey   , weight 1 context []
     2 xx  -->  {4 990} = And when it reached a certain age    , weight 0.5 context []
     3 xx  -->  {4 991} = She'd serve it on a tray   , weight 1 context []

</pre>

## Searching a graph

We need to respect the geometry of the semantic spacetime when tracing and presenting paths.
Out major focus will tend to be by STtype.

* Find a starting place (random lookup).
* Decide on the capture region and criterion for search.
* * Select the cone of a particular STtype, for a picture of its relationships.
* * Find all possible paths, without restriction on semantics.

The search patterns can be:
<pre>
            by Name                                    GetNodeNotes/Orbits
START match by Chapter     ---> (set of NodePtr)  -->  GetFwdPaths (by STtype)
            by first Arrow                             GetFwdBwdPaths (by signless STtype)
            by Context                                 GetEntireCone (for all types)
</pre>

## Low level wrapper functions 

In general, you will want to use the special functions written for
querying the data.  These return data into Go structures directly,
performing all the marshalling and de-marshalling. The following are
basic workhorses. You will not normally use these.
For example, [see demo](https://github.com/markburgess/SSTorytime/blob/main/src/demo_pocs/postgres_stories.go).

## Matroid Analysis Functions (nodes by appointed roles)

For examples, [see demo](https://github.com/markburgess/SSTorytime/blob/main/src/demo_pocs/search_clusters_functions.go) and [example](https://github.com/markburgess/SSTorytime/blob/main/src/demo_pocs/search_clusters.go).

These functions will most likely be used during browsing of data, when getting a feel for the size and shape of the data.

* `GetAppointmentArrayByArrow(ctx PoSST, context []string,chapter string) map[ArrowPtr][]NodePtr` - return a map of groups of nodes formed as matroids to arrows of all types, classified by arrow type.

* `GetAppointmentArrayBySSType(ctx PoSST) map[int][]NodePtr` - return a map of groups of nodes formed as matroids to arrows classified by STType.

* `GetAppointmentHistogramByArrow(ctx PoSST) map[ArrowPtr]int` - Find the group (member frequency) sizes of the above groups by arrow.

* `GetAppointmentHistogramBySSType(ctx PoSST) map[int]int` - Find the group (member frequency) sizes of the above groups by STType.

* `GetAppointmentNodesByArrow(ctx PoSST) []ArrowAppointment` - Return the group members of a matroid by arrow type.

* `GetAppointmentNodesBySTType(ctx PoSST) []STTypeAppointment` - Return the group members of a matroid by STType.



## Basic queries from SQL

Using perfectly standard SQL, you can interrogate the database established by N4L or the low level API
functions.

### Tables

* To show the different tables:
<pre>
$ psql storyline

storyline=# \dt
              List of relations
 Schema |      Name      | Type  |   Owner    
--------+----------------+-------+------------
 public | arrowdirectory | table | sstoryline
 public | arrowinverses  | table | sstoryline
 public | node           | table | sstoryline
 public | nodearrownode  | table | sstoryline
(4 rows)

</pre>
* To query these, we look at the members:
<pre>
storyline=# \d node
                Table "public.node"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
 nptr   | nodeptr |           |          | 
 l      | integer |           |          | 
 s      | text    |           |          | 
 chap   | text    |           |          | 
 im3    | link[]  |           |          | 
 im2    | link[]  |           |          | 
 im1    | link[]  |           |          | 
 in0    | link[]  |           |          | 
 il1    | link[]  |           |          | 
 ic2    | link[]  |           |          | 
 ie3    | link[]  |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "node_chan_l_s_idx" btree (((nptr).chan), l, s)

</pre>

### Nodes

Now try:
<pre>
storyline=# select S,chap from Node limit 10;
     s      |       chap       
------------+------------------
 please     | notes on chinese
 yes        | notes on chinese
 请          | notes on chinese
 qǐng       | notes on chinese
 thankyou   | notes on chinese
 Méiyǒu     | notes on chinese
 谢谢        | notes on chinese
 xièxiè     | notes on chinese
 是的        | notes on chinese
 请在这里等    | notes on chinese
(10 rows)

</pre>

* An alternative view of relations is provided by NodeArrowNode:
<pre>
storyline=# select *  from NodeArrowNode LIMIT 10;
 nfrom | sttype | arr | wgt |              ctx              |   nto   
-------+--------+-----+-----+-------------------------------+---------
 (1,0) |     -1 |  69 |   1 | {please,"thank you",thankyou} | (1,1)
 (1,1) |     -1 |  67 |   1 | {thankyou,please,"thank you"} | (1,2)
 (1,1) |      1 |  68 |   1 | {thankyou,please,"thank you"} | (1,0)
 (1,1) |      1 |  68 |   1 | {news,online}                 | (2,291)
 (1,2) |      1 |  66 |   1 | {thankyou,please,"thank you"} | (1,1)
 (1,3) |     -1 |  69 |   1 | {please,"thank you",thankyou} | (1,4)
 (1,4) |     -1 |  67 |   1 | {please,"thank you",thankyou} | (1,5)
 (1,4) |      1 |  68 |   1 | {please,"thank you",thankyou} | (1,3)
 (1,5) |      1 |  66 |   1 | {please,"thank you",thankyou} | (1,4)
 (1,6) |     -1 |  67 |   1 | {please,"thank you",thankyou} | (4,0)
(10 rows)

</pre>

Notice how nodes (`nfrom`,`nto`,`nptr? ) and arrows (`arr`) are represented by pointer references
that are integers. When working with the graph, we often don't need to know the names
of things, we can get away with deferring the lookup of the actual data until we find what we're
looking for. That information can be cached so as to minimize the data transferred over the wire.

<pre>
storyline=# select S from Node where NPtr=(1,5);
   s    
--------
 xièxiè
(1 row)

</pre>

### Links and Arrows

A link is a composite relation that involves an arrow (pointer), a context,
and a destination node. Links are anchored to their origin nodes in the `Node` table
in the six columns `im3`, `im2`, `im1`, `in0`, `il1`, `ic2`, `ie3`.  
To find the links of type `Leads to':
<pre>
storyline=# select Il1 from Node where NPtr=(1,5);
                                       il1                                        
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"(66,1,\"{ \"\"please\"\", \"\"thank you\"\", \"\"thankyou\"\" }\",\"(1,4)\")"}
(1 row)

</pre>

Arrows are defined for each arrow pointer in the arrow directory:

<pre>
storyline=# select * from arrowdirectory limit 10;
 staindex |         long         | short | arrptr 
----------+----------------------+-------+--------
        4 | leads to             | lt    |      0
        2 | arriving from        | af    |      1
        4 | forwards             | fwd   |      2
        2 | backwards            | bwd   |      3
        4 | affects              | aff   |      4
        2 | affected by          | baff  |      5
        4 | causes               | cf    |      6
        2 | is caused by         | cb    |      7
        4 | used for             | for   |      8
        2 | is a possible use of | use   |      9
(10 rows)

</pre>

## The Go(lang) interfaces

The SSToryline package tries to make querying the data structures easy, by providing
generic scriptable functions that can be used easily in Go.

The open a database connection, to make any kind of query, with the help of the SSToryline package:
<pre>

package main

import (
	"fmt"
        SST "SSTorytime"
)

//******************************************************************

const (
	host     = "localhost"
	port     = 5432
	user     = "sstoryline"
	password = "sst_1234"
	dbname   = "storyline"
)

//******************************************************************

func main() {

	load_arrows := false

	ctx := SST.Open(load_arrows)

	row,err := ctx.DB.Query("SELECT NFrom,Arr,NTo FROM NodeArrowNode LIMIT 10")

	var a,c string	
	var b int

	for row.Next() {		
		err = row.Scan(&a,&b,&c)
		fmt.Println(a,b,c)
	}
	
	row.Close()

	SST.Close(ctx)
}

</pre>
