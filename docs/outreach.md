# Outreach and related projects

I'll try to compile references to related note taking and semantic search projects here.
SSToryline could potentially integrate with these projects, as it solves a very different
problem to the way people normally think about knowledge.

In May 2025, several handfuls of people have contacted me about the project, expressing interest
and usefulness in their own work. For privacy, I won't list these contacts here, but this is
encouraging news.
