# The notes tool

The `notes` tool is the simplest way of retrieving what you wrote in your notes.N4L file. It just outputs what you entered in
roughly the same order as your original input, page by page. This is useful when reading things back as you wrote them.

Often we remember that we wrote something in a certain place, but we don't remember the details. This tool helps you to
see how you intentionally wrote the notes, but without comments and variables.

`notes` works page by page.
