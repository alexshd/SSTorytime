# How does context work?

Context is the "hard problem" of knowledge management. In its simplest form, we use it
as disambiguation, like the disambiguation pages in Wikipedia for a name like "queen". There
are many possible things it could refer to, but only one of them is the one we are looking for.
We need to be more specific.

We use the _context_ in which we experienced something as a "lookup key"
for memories. It's not like the primary keys we feed to a database,
e.g. something like a name, a phone or social security number,
etc. Cognitive processes use sensory inputs to encode memory. How does
one feed that into a directory listing to get an answer? And how do we
list what was there?

The knowledge graph is a way of painting a picture of a scene, but we still need to find the right scene.
Modern recognition methods can match sensory inputs like vision and sound as well as writing now, but
they don't solve the problem of how to know which experience is the correct match given a generic
sensory input. There was that one time at band camp....

## The technical challenge of context

Adding context through N4L is straightforwardish, and we can let the compiler ensure consistency.
Adding Nodes ad hoc with `Vertex() / Edge()` etc is risky and context will cease to work in detail.
We can simplify this too by factoring away context, forcing API users to select an already an defined
context.

The technical challenge of context is that the amount of context in a sensory stream is usually
much greater than the part you actually want to remember, so knowledge data may quickly become
dominated by context. We don't want to store intentionally selected items together with ambient
keys and other "noise", so we need to be careful about how to structure a graph.

The choice to limit context to links rather than nodes causes problems for NodeArrowNode caching.
Bare nodes without links can be represented with context 'any' by always registering an 'empty' link
(which has no inverse). This ensures that even linkless nodes will appear in the NodeArrowNode cache.

Computing the NodeArrowNode cache naively by going through the nodes leads to a huge scaling and fragmentation
problem, which has led to two revisions of the algorithm.
Taking nodes one by one and intervleaving entries for Node and NodeArrowNode leads to back and forth fragmentation and
memory inefficiency. A 10x increase in performance is achieved just by doing all Nodes first and then NodeArrowNode.
Adding all the NodeArrowNodes in one go is easy because
there is no need to check for idempotent entry. However, allowing appending chapters later does require to ensure
idempotence, so this remains an issue. The solution is to regenerate the entire list as a single large transaction
after all nodes are added. This also solves the fragmentation issue.

Originally context was stored as an array of strings for each node, but this eventually scales poorly--eating
up memory and taking time during idempotence updates.

## Role

Context plays two roles. We know from Promise Thory that each fragment of
potential "donor" knowledge promises certain information (+), but that a receiver may promise
to listen only to another set of "receptor" information (-). The overlap between what is offered (donation)
and what is accepted (reception) is the result of a lookup. Recptor information is usually quite small
and narrow compared to the entirety of the original context signal. So we split these representations
into two parts:

- Original signal is encoded as graph nodes that annotate captured events.
- Query context is encoded in the `:: tags ::` that break up notes into sections.

When we are searching, we primarily use the original signal nodes. When we are filtering
or narrowing a search, we use the `:: tags ::`.

_Note that although context fragments interact in a graph, it is more in the manner of an ad hoc network.
Context fragments are like "free radicals" in the chemistry of semantics.
Trying to form a fixed graph of context fragments is a fools errand that would be extremely constly
in memory and would quickly become outdated. It is constantly reshaping itself for the user._

We always divide context into:

- ambient (overlap) cases and
- the rest (which are specially intended parts)

and record these separately. Intentional parts become irrelevant after a short time because they are not reused.
But ambient parts are reused for longer (although their specific intentionality is becoming
diluted by repeated use in different contexts), so we keep mainly ambient context as clusters to tell the user
the previous contexts in which something occurred.
Additionally, we keep path search cases separate from ad hoc lookups, and these have different intentionality.

Context is still expensive to store without an explicit graph, because we need to remember each combination
as well as the individual fragments. The fractions can be kept in two maps: for ambient and intentional, each for
path and ad hoc look ups. Then we also recall an ordered log (like a moving window) of combinations (get one, drop one).

We use a `CONTEXT_WINDOW_DURATION` of 3 hours for tracking related queries, which is probably longer than human attention, to give
some superpowers, but not so long that it is incomprehensible.

## Context in the `text2N4L` tool

When we are scanning raw text using the helper tool, we can generate the (+) donor
context fragments automatically, but we can't generate acceptor context tags automatically.
Only you can do that, because only you know what you might be looking for in the information.
It isn't universal and automatic--it's based in your intent.

Intent and intentionality play a large role in understanding context: [The Role of Intent and Context Knowledge Graphs With Cognitive Agents](https://medium.com/@mark-burgess-oslo-mb/the-role-of-intent-and-context-knowledge-graphs-with-cognitive-agents-fb45d8dfb34d)

Note that, when scanning a long document, resulting in a large N4L
file, loading of data becomes very slow. This is because Unicode
parsing efficiency is low, and because the time grows easily like the
square of the length of the file--so we need to be cautious is dumping large amounts of data
into a knowledge store without good reason. You might need to set aside a morning to upload
an example like Moby Dick.

## An idealized approximation

The way we refer to contexts has to be simple and easy to document,
otherwise we won't capture it. My experience with the CFEngine
cognitive agent taught some valuable lessons here. CFEngine
intuitively did several things right. What CFEngine did was to use
"smart sensors" to characterize its environment every time is woke up:
to ask, where am I, who am I? What am I supposed to be doing?

Using this approach in as simple a way as possible, let's define context
as a kind of _scope of experience_. Programmers understand scope as an
bounded environment in which certain variables are available and others
are hidden. It's like a chapter in a book, or a separate document.
So, we can model as conext in two parts for simplicity:

```
  ( scene   , thoughts and sensory impressions ... )
  ( chapter , environmental fragments   .... )
```

Chapters or scenes are non-overlapping collections of information, events, etc, Christmas 2012.
Sensory fragments are potentially shared or overlapping aspects on an experience, e.g.
it was Monday, or the weather was hot. Other parts of our context come from our train of thought
at the time of the event in question. When we're trying to recall something, e.g. the word in
French for baguette, we want to label that knowledge with those sensory cues: at the restaurant,
in the supermarche, etc.

- A chapter or scene is partitioned by the exterior physical world of space and time.
- A train of thought is partitioned by the interior virtual world of our imagined or remembered space and time.

## Labelling scenes

- We use the ` - chapter name` syntax to name a chapter in N4L.
- We use the `:: ... ::` syntax in N4L to label context.

When we record information, we list the characters in the scene as "nodes" and their relationships
and meanings through the "links" between them. But, we also collect several of those references under
a subheading of the chapter that lists the fragments of thought we would want to use to remember
that information: the where, when, what, how, and even why!

```n4l
 :: random thoughts ::

   We're using too much cloud CPU (example of) economic priorities

 :: Monday standup meeting, discussion about Easter holiday, urgent work ::

   Sally reported a problem with ssh keys (possibly about)  security
                                  "       (may cause bug)   can't access the dashboard
```

In a more complex scenario, we might use context is a number of ways. What matters is that
it is intuitive to us, because it represents the way we think. Context is very personal.
What helps you to remember will not necessarily be what helps others to remember. This is
why notes and knowledge are not easy to share. Take this example:

```n4l
- cluedo: Forensic map of a Murder Most Horrid

 // invariants and dependencies define first, as we may need to refer to them

## Looking it up later

When we come to look up these facts, we use context to disambiguate.
What we remember may be limited, so we want to match the fragments we know:
We don't want to look up a road, something to do with summer. A person, scarlet or something like that.

```bash
searchN4L  summer in context place
searchN4L  scarlet in the context of person
searchN4L  some car in chapter cluedo
searchN4L  fork in context restaurant chapter chinese
```

## Socializing knowledge

Wikis and databases are potentially places where knowledge goes to die. If we drop information
into a dark place where no one goes, it won't be found intentionally.

To make knowledge effective, we need to generate the intent to find it and to use it.

The way individual knowledge becomes shared knowledge is through socializing. We have to talk
about it, repeat it, share it, and use it regularly. This is the opposite of thinking about
search keys. What this should tell us is that databases and wikis are not places for
shared knowledge. They are only usable by the particular group who happens to know the context
for looking up the information.

- We need to know that the information is in a datastore before trying to find it.
- We need to have a good idea about what we should look for, i.e. the right context.

Recall the project slogan:

"_It's not knowledge if you don't know it._"
